Touch is used to convey information, emotions, and other \nsocial cues. Still, everyday remote communication remains mainly auditive or audio-visual. The theme of this \narticle, interpersonal haptic communication, refers to any communication system that supports mediation of \ntouch between two or more persons. We first present a scoping review of the state of the art in interpersonal \nhaptic communication, including physiological and psychological basis of touch, affective and social touch, and \nmediated social touch. We then discuss emerging research themes that shape the future of interpersonal haptic \ncommunication, identify research gaps and propose key research directions for each theme. Finally, societal \nimpact and ethical aspects are discussed.   \nIntroduction \nTouch has an important role in social communication, regulating \nphysiological states and biological and social development (Montagu, \n1972 ). Hertenstein et al. (2006) state that because of its importance in \nearly life, touch may establish the foundation of all other forms of \nhuman communication. Even though the frequency of touch contact \ndecreases after childhood, interpersonal touch is equally important in \nadulthood (Jones & Yarbrough, 1985 ). Touch can have common \nmeanings between cultures, and fundamental uses include communi -\ncation of comfort, attachment, and aggression (Hertenstein et al., 2006 ). \nThe role of touch in everyday non-remote communication between \npeople (Gallace and Spence, 2010 ) is not supported in remote commu -\nnication. Haptic communication systems can be divided into two broad \ncategories based on the type of information communicated: \ntask-oriented or affective. The bulk of research has focused on \ntask-oriented, non-affective communication. For instance, it is possible \nto send haptic guidance cues to a person walking towards a point of \ninterest (Scheggi et al., 2014 ) or convey information of person \u2019s pres-\nence (Lenay et al., 2011 ). Task-oriented information can be communi -\ncated by using Tactons (Brewster and Brown, 2001; Hoggan et al., 2009 ) \nor systems like Tactile Braille (Rantala et al., 2009 ; Rantala et al., \n2013a ). \nThis article is focused on interpersonal haptic communication, with a \nspecific emphasis on affective touch. With interpersonal haptic communication, we refer to any communication system that supports \nmediation of touch between two or more persons. The scoping review \nwas prepared as follows. First, we collected an extensive set of all studies \nfrom the most relevant fields in interpersonal communication.

We \nrely on discriminative touch when manipulating objects or exploring our \nsurroundings. Emotional touch is mediated by a different system that \ngets activated via a range of haptic social interactions such as grooming \nand nurturing (McGlone, 2007 ). In the next sections, we provide concise \noverviews of both discriminative and emotional touch with focus on the \nlatter. \nDiscriminative touch \nWhen we use tools or interact with objects, discriminative touch is \nactivated. During discriminative touch, humans typically touch surfaces \nand objects with the glabrous (i.e., non-hairy) fingertips and palms. \nWhile there are up to 12 classes of afferent fibers in the glabrous skin \n(Johnson et al., 2000 ), the afferents mainly responsible for discrimina -\ntive sensibility are four mechanoreceptive afferents: Merkel receptors, \nMeissner corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, and Ruffini endings (Gold-\nstein, 1999 ). These receptors respond to different types of touch stimuli: \nMerkel receptors sense low frequency pushing against the skin (Gold-\nstein, 1999 ) via the mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel (Woo et al., 2014 ). \nMeissner corpuscles detect stimuli such as taps on the skin and small \nbumps or ridges on surfaces (Goldstein, 1999 ). Pacinian corpuscles sense \npoorly localized high-frequency vibration such as the hum of an electric \nmotor and frictional displacement of skin when moving one\u2019s hand \nacross an object (McGlone, 2007 ). Ruffini endings sense stretching of \nskin and movement of joints. In addition, thermoreceptors, chemore -\nceptors, and nociceptors also have specific roles in sensing touch. \nThermoreceptors sense temperature such as feelings of cold and warmth \n(Darian-Smith & Johnson, 1977 ). Direct chemoreceptors react to \nchemical stimuli through taste buds in the tongue (Chandrashekar et al., \n2006 ). Nociceptors respond to stimuli that can cause tissue damage and \nbe perceived as painful (Scholz & Woolf, 2002 ). \nEmotional touch \nA distinction worth mentioning is between the terms affect and \nemotion. Affect refers to the basic sense of feeling, often measured with \ntwo or three dimensions (valence: how pleasant or unpleasant one feels, \narousal: how calm or agitated one feels, and dominance: how controlled \nor under control one feels). Emotions are the result of conscious cognitive \nbehavior such as reflecting, weighing up the odds (Barrett, 2017 ). \nEmotions are more complex and constructed over time while affects are \npunctual demonstrations that one feels, and might not be aware of them. \nAffects are strongly related to visceral feeling and interoception, sensory \nperception from inside the body. The terms emotional touch and affective \ntouch have been interchangeably used by the research community \n(McGlone et al., 2014 ). \nThe processing of affective touch begins at the skin level (McGlone \net al., 2007 ; Morrison et al., 2011b ). The anatomy of the skin and touch \nsensations varies between glabrous and non-glabrous sites of the human \nbody (e.g., Olausson et al., 2008 ; McGlone & Reilly, 2010 ). The skin is a \nnetwork of thin, slow-conducting afferent (C and A\u03b4) fibers which \ntransmit information. Traditionally, mechanoreception was attributed \nexclusively to thick, fast-conducting (A\u03b2) afferents.

Traditionally, mechanoreception was attributed \nexclusively to thick, fast-conducting (A\u03b2) afferents. Recent evidence, \nhowever, notes that C-tactile (CT) afferents present at non-glabrous \nbody sites comprise a second anatomically and functionally distinct \nsystem signaling touch in humans (Bj\u00a8ornsdotter et al., 2010 ). These \nunmyelinated, slow-conducting CT afferents are strongly associated \nwith coding the emotional properties of pain, itch or tickle, and \nroughness and pleasantness sensations (Vallbo et al., 1996 ; Pawling \net al., 2017 ; Sailer et al., 2020 ). Two important factors affecting CT af-\nferents are the force and velocity of the stimulus. Overall, soft, slow, and \nshort velocity movements tend to evoke more pleasant experiences than hard strokes (Sailer and Ackerley, 2019 ), and rough surfaces or fast \nvelocity are experienced as less pleasant than smooth ones (Tsalamal \net al., 2018 ; Greco et al., 2019 ). The density of the CT afferents varies \nbetween individuals and, therefore, affects the experienced pleasantness \nof tactile stimulation (Morrison et al., 2011b ). \nIn addition, even though CT afferents are argued to be most promi -\nnent in non-glabrous body sites, recent evidence supports the existence \nof sparse amount of such afferents in the palm area (e.g., Watkins et al., \n2021 ) supporting the ability to promote affective and emotional re-\nactions when glabrous body sites are stimulated. Evoking painful or \npleasurable tactile experiences on glabrous skin is also not excluded (e. \ng., Essick et al., 2010 ). However, touch is often perceived as more \npleasant in non-glabrous than glabrous body sites (e.g., Ackerley et al., \n2014 ). \nAmong the factors that affect the perceived pleasantness in glabrous \nskin are roughness, force, and temperature (Kl\u00a8ocker et al., 2014 ). The \ntexture of the surface affects the rated pleasantness in both non-glabrous \nand glabrous body sites (e.g., Ackerley et al., 2014 ). The forearm is more \nsusceptible to hardness of a stroke than the palm, providing additional \nevidence about the role of CT afferents as mediators of pleasant touch \n(Yu et al., 2019 ). The pleasantness rating of brush stroking gestures is \nhigher when the stroking velocity is suitable for activating CT afferents \n(e.g., 3m/s) in comparison to other velocities (L\u00a8oken et al., 2009 ) and \nprior exposures affect the ratings of both CT and non-CT touch (Sailer \nand Ackerley, 2019; Yokosaka et al., 2020 ). People who are touched \nrarely do not rate CT touch as pleasant compared to people who are \ntouched regularly (Sailer & Ackerley, 2019 ). The pleasantness rating of \ntactile surfaces is also affected by finger movement velocity and force \nduring object manipulation. People switch touch behavior depending on \nthe manipulated object, e.g., pushing motions with unpleasant and \ngestures with pleasant objects (Yokosaka et al. 2020 ). \nTemperature and wetness sensations are also associated with the \nfunctionality of the pain \u2013 pleasantness system.

The thermal subsystem \nconsists of warm and cold receptors. Warm receptors fire to temperature \nincreases up to 45\u25e6C (Stevens, 1991 ) with higher temperatures often \nactivating the sensation of pain (e.g., Heller and Schiff, 1991 ). There is a \ntendency to rate warm stimulation under the pain threshold as pleasant \n(e.g., Sung et al., 2007 ; Salminen et al., 2011 ; Salminen et al., 2013 ). \nSticky, cold, or wet textures temperatures are, on the other hand, often \nperceived as disgusting (e.g., Kanosue et al., 2002 ; Saluja & Stevenson, \n2019 ). \nAffective communication through haptic technologies \nReplicating the feel of real human touch contact is challenging. Even \nthough current technology is not sophisticated enough to mimic all the \nqualities of real touch such as pressure, grip, dryness, and texture, \ndifferent haptic technologies can simulate it (e.g., Huisman, 2016 ; Si-\nmons et al., 2020 ). In this Section, we present the technologies that have \nbeen used to produce touch stimulation for interpersonal \ncommunication. \nVibrotactile \nVibrotactile stimulation is based on an eccentric rotating mass, voice \ncoils, solenoids, piezoelectric elements, electroactive polymers, or other \nrelated technologies (Choi and Kuchenbecker, 2013 ). The advantages of \nvibrotactile actuators include simple and inexpensive technology as well \nas easy control. The actuators are typically either embedded in a \nportable device (e.g., Dobson et al., 2001 ; Rantala et al., 2011 ; Fur-\nukawa et al., 2012 ; Hoggan et al., 2012 ) or attached to a wearable (e.g., \nCabibihan & Chauhan, 2017 ; Huisman et al., 2013 ). The vibration can \nbe localized so that only a specific area of the skin is stimulated, or it can \nbe generalized so that an entire device vibrates. The downside is that \nvibrotactile actuators have limited expressiveness as vibration of the \nskin is only one of the qualities of interpersonal touch. Nevertheless, R.

Taxonomies of emotional terms associated with vibrotactile \nstimuli have been made available to help haptic designers identify more \nefficient vibrotactile emotional signatures (Seifi et al., 2015; Seifi et al., \n2018). \nThermal \nThe most typical approach to temperature is to use Peltier elements \nthat create a temperature difference at the junctions of two dissimilar \nconductors when a DC current passes through. Depending on the di-\nrection of the used current, one side of the Peltier cools and the other \nside heats (Jones & Ho, 2008). This makes it possible to create both \nwarming and cooling sensations. Heating elements have been attached, \nfor example, to a belt (Gooch & Watts, 2010), model of a hand (Gooch & \nWatts, 2012), bracelet (Suhonen et al., 2012) and mobile phone (Wilson \net al., 2011). Challenges in using temperature variations include the \nlimited range of different sensations, spatial and temporal sensitivity \n(Jones & Ho, 2008), and high-power consumption. Due to the poor \nspatial sensitivity, dense arrays of thermal actuators rarely provide \nbenefit. Additionally, the temporal modulation of the temperature re-\nquires a few seconds to feel the variation. The amount of information \nthat can be communicated with thermal actuators is lower than with \nvibrotactile actuators. \nForce \nForce feedback devices can stimulate the muscles, joints, and ten-\ndons. Typically, these devices are used for exerting forces on the torso or \nlimbs. In interpersonal haptic communication scenarios, force feedback \ncan be used in diverse ways when stimulating only the skin is not suf-\nficient. A vest or a jacket can apply pressure around the upper torso to \nmimic a hug (Teh et al., 2012; Tsetserukou, 2010). Additional devices \nhave emerged such as armbands for creating a squeezing sensation on \nthe upper arm (Wang et al., 2012), robotic hand for mediated hand -\nshaking (Nakanishi et al., 2014), rotating rollers for playful interaction \n(Brave & Dahley, 1997), and haptic knobs for communicating emotions \n(Smith & MacLean, 2007). \nContactless \nContactless alternatives are valuable especially in virtual and \naugmented reality applications, where requiring the user to touch or \nwear a physical device impedes natural user interaction (Sodhi et al., \n2013), or decreases immersion (Rakkolainen et al., 2021). One approach \nto create contactless mid-air stimulation is to use controlled air streams \nthat exert pressure again the skin. This can be achieved by using fans or \npressurized air jets (Suzuki et al., 2005). Another approach is to use air \nvortex rings that transfer pressure to the skin or clothes upon contact \n(Sodhi et al., 2013). The most current contactless technology is based on \nthe use of ultrasound (Carter et al., 2013; Iwamoto et al., 2008). With \nultrasound, it is possible to exert pressure on multiple points on the skin \n(Rakkolainen et al., 2021).

We first \ndiscuss the role of social touch in human communication. Next, medi -\nated social touch is defined. Finally, we present a summary of research in mediated affective and social touch. \nSocial touch \nSocial touch is often affectionate, promoting relational, psychologi -\ncal, and physical wellbeing by reducing stress (Jakubiak and Feeney, \n2017). Besides stress reduction (Morrison, 2016), interpersonal touch \ncan also decrease conflicts (Murphy et al., 2018), elevate relational \nwell-being (Jakubiak and Feeney, 2019) and activate the neurocognitive \nprocesses underlying goal-directed behavior (Saunders et al., 2018). A \ndetailed list of different responses associated with social touch in \ndifferent age groups can be found in Field (2019). \nTactile behaviors and responses to touching are greatly affected by \nculture, gender, social closeness, and personality traits such as self- \nesteem (e.g., Hertenstein & Keltner, 2011; Gallace & Spence, 2010). \nInterpersonal tactile communication can trigger anxiety in people \nsuffering from it (Wilhelm et al., 2001) while those with a higher need \nfor interpersonal touch show an increased level of confidence after being \ntouched (Nuszbaum et al., 2014). People adjust the degree of touch \nbased on sympathy experienced towards the individual being touched \n(Strauss et al., 2020). Some people are touch avoidant (Johansson, \n2013) such as individuals with autistic traits (Voos et al., 2013). Further, \nmotives to touch another person reflect the well-being of the social \nrelationship in question (Jakubiak et al., 2020). \nThe basic elements of social touch overlap with emotional touch. \nSkin is a social organ and interpersonal, skin-to-skin touch can be \nperceived as highly pleasurable (Morrison et al., 2010). Touching and \nsensing another person\u2019s skin is more pleasant than one\u2019s own skin \n(Guest et al., 2009). The pleasant experiences related to social touch can \nbe evoked visually, by seeing caressing gestures (Morrison et al., 2011a). \nResearch on social tactile gestures and their responses has a long \ntradition. Jones and Yarbrough (1985) showed distinct meanings of \ntouch in communicating, for example, positive emotions (i.e., support, \nappreciation, inclusion, sexual interest, and affection) or controlled \ntouches (i.e., compliance, attention-getting). Gestures like squeezing \nand patting are associated with playfulness and stroking with sexual \ndesire (Nguyen et al., 1975). Some tactile expressions have later been \nsuccessfully associated with several emotions like anger, fear, or sym-\npathy (Hertenstein et al., 2006), including simple social gestures like \ngrooming (McGlone et al., 2016). \nOne important factor in pleasant touch is the human factor. Pleasant \nexperiences evoked by an object are not as strong as those evoked by \nanother human being (Wijaya et al., 2020). This aspect is not only \nimportant but also challenging in the design of haptic communication \ntechnology.

Recently, several researchers have expressed their \nconcern over the fact that the use of social touch has decreased in daily \nlife over the course of the last 20 years and suggest that mediated haptics \ncould help to overcome this issue (Jewitt et al. 2021). \nResearch has shown that mediated social touch can modulate phys-\niological responses, increase trust and affection, help establish bonds \nbetween humans, and initiate pro-social behavior (Van Erp & Toet, \n2015). In general, humans use, experience, and react to mediated social \ntouch similarly to direct touch (Bailenson & Yee, 2007). Mediated touch \ncan lower the heart rate of participants after they watch a sad video clip \n(Cabibihan, 2017). It can also increase sympathy and intimacy towards R.

During a remote storytelling experi -\nment, mediated touch increased the sense of connectedness (Wang et al., \n2012 ). Finally, mediated touch can increase pro-social, altruistic \nbehavior, and willingness to comply with a request (Haans & IJssel -\nsteijn, 2009 ). Thus, virtual touch can be processed like direct touch \n(Haans et al., 2014 ). These encouraging findings from different social \ncontexts support the development of remote haptics. \nExamples of mediated affective and social touch \nAffective haptics (Tsetserukou et al., 2009 ) is defined as a field that \nstudies and designs haptic systems capable of eliciting, enhancing, or \ninfluencing human emotions. The field integrates affective computing, \nhaptic technology, and user experience (Eid & Osman, 2015 ). However, \nup to date the design of most haptic interfaces has focused on discrim -\ninative touch while potential affective qualities have been neglected \n(Bianchi et al., 2017 ). Only recently, the affective qualities of haptics \nhave been integrated as a part of interface design, with varying success \n(Schneider et al., 2017 ). \nIn the following subsections, we discuss affective responses to haptic \nstimulation and provide insight on the use of haptics to evoke emotions \nin remote, social communication settings. Most often, affective qualities \nor dimensions of mediated social touch are measured using the pleasure- \narousal-dominance (PAD) emotional state model by Mehrabian and \nRussell (1974) . PAD consists of the dimensions of valence (i.e., from \nunpleasant to pleasant), arousal (i.e., from calm or relaxed to aroused) \nwhich is related to the motivational system of humans, namely acti-\nvating appetitive and defensing systems (Bradley & Lang, 2000 ), and \ndominance. Dominance is less explored in haptics research, but it is \nequally important from the perspective of the current article since it is \nrelated to the social context (Bradley & Lang, 1994 ). \nAffective responses to haptic stimulation \nMost of the previous research that explored affective responses to \nhaptic stimulation did not include a specific communicational context \nbut pre-programmed or device-initiated haptic output. Vibrotactile ac-\ntuators have been integrated in hand-held devices or wearables for \npleasant sensations (Seifi & Maclean, 2013 ; Yoo et al., 2015 ; Chandra \net al., 2018 ) or to mimic touch gestures tickling and stroking (Knoop & \nRossiter, 2015 ). The timing of the vibrotactile stimulation when \nmanipulating surfaces like a touchscreen can affect the perceived \npleasantness (Lylykangas et al., 2011 ). \nWhen combined with visual (Akshita et al., 2015 ) or auditory stim-\nulation (Salminen et al., 2012 ), vibrotactile stimuli contribute to high \narousal values. Visual qualities seem to dominate the overall affective \nqualities of the multimodal stimulation consisting partly of vibrotactile \nhaptic stimuli (Jiao & Xu, 2020 ) but vibrotactile stimulation is effective \nin amplifying the emotions experienced (Mazzoni and Bryan-Kinns, \n2016a ). Unpleasant vibrotactile stimuli are reported as more pleasant in \nthe presence of environmental noise, further suggesting that such \nstimulation is not effective in creating strong affective responses in the \npresence of other modality inputs (Salminen et al., 2009 ; Salminen et al., \n2011 ). Because of the strong interaction between vibrotactile stimuli \nand other modalities, alternative means of triggering affective responses \nvia haptics need to be considered. \nThermal stimulation is centrally related to the feeling of pleasure and", "doc_id": "ae43e4e3-f3a3-4038-893a-06ade7d1e7c3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cd751dd37beeeafd5520b193b4d9435b03fb2e59972cb7cabbebbac64399fe5c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "1-s2.0-S1071581922001070-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3749}, "relationships": {"1": "0360fa08-30de-4a14-bd2e-37b1dd7b5ebd", "3": "7f89567b-dd39-4659-93d9-27a2eb80b1ca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f89567b-dd39-4659-93d9-27a2eb80b1ca": {"__data__": {"text": "multimodal stimulation consisting partly of vibrotactile \nhaptic stimuli (Jiao & Xu, 2020 ) but vibrotactile stimulation is effective \nin amplifying the emotions experienced (Mazzoni and Bryan-Kinns, \n2016a ).

Because of the strong interaction between vibrotactile stimuli \nand other modalities, alternative means of triggering affective responses \nvia haptics need to be considered. \nThermal stimulation is centrally related to the feeling of pleasure and \narousal (Wilson et al., 2016 ). Overall, the previous research shows that \nstimuli mildly warmer than the human skin temperature (e.g., +2\u25e6C) are \nrated as pleasant; while stimuli aiming to heat the skin more (e.g., +6\u25e6C) \nare rated as unpleasant and arousing even though the stimulation would \nnot reach the thermal pain threshold (Salminen et al., 2011 ; Salminen \net al., 2013 ). However, as with vibrotactile stimulation, there is initial \nevidence suggesting that information acquired by other modalities \nwould dominate the perception of pleasantness, while thermal stimu -\nlation would dominate the perception of arousal (e.g., Tewell et al., 2017 ). \nMid-air haptics can effectively produce haptic sensations all over the \nbody, and by manipulating the intensity and movement of these stimuli, \nit is possible to affect the experienced valence, arousal, and dominance \n(Sato and Ueoka, 2017; Tsalamlal et al., 2015 ). Further, mid-air haptics \ncan be expressive and successfully mediate complex emotional states \nsuch as happiness, sadness, excitedness, or fear (Obrist et al., 2015 ). \nRecently, the CT touch theory has been motivating researchers to \nuse, for example, fabric-based tactile displays. The initial results show \nthat modulating the strength, texture, duration, and velocity of a \nstroking gesture similar to a caress affected the valence ratings; where \nfast movements were rated as unpleasant and slow movements were \nrated as pleasant (Bianchi et al., 2014; Taneja et al., 2021; Toet et al., \n2011; Zhu et al., 2020 ). These fabric-based interfaces, worn usually as \nsleeves, are effective in modulating the perceived arousal, excited vs. \ncalm, when the pace of the haptic stimulation is varied (Papadopoulou \net al., 2019 ). \nDespite the technology used, there is a negative correlation between \nthe rated haptic stimulus pleasantness and its arousal (Salminen et al., \n2008 ; Zheng and Morrell, 2012 ; Mazzoni & Bryan-Kinns, 2015 ). Further, \nthere is hardly a conclusion about which parameters of the haptic system \ncan be used to trigger affective experiences via a mediated interface. \nSchneider et al. (2016) suggest that vibrotactile icons require more \nresearch and the use of high-quality analytical tools like crowdsourcing \ncan help reduce the gap. \nBy combining different haptic technologies like vibrotactile and \nthermal, the available range of emotions evoked by the haptic stimula -\ntion can be enriched (e.g., Wilson & Brewster, 2017 ). At the moment, \ncombining different haptic technologies like warmth and vibration has \nbeen rare, despite the fact that wearable devices which enable touch \nstimulation via multiple methods have been evaluated positively \n(Arafsha et al., 2015 ). \nAffective haptics in communicational setting \nMediated social touch has potential in various forms of emotion- \nrelated communication such as establishing connectedness between \nromantic couples (Haans & IJsselsteijn, 2006 ).", "doc_id": "7f89567b-dd39-4659-93d9-27a2eb80b1ca", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "823e45a15ab4903adb60e45ab4bf363c52dd249a9f31c8283da6f27a4cade1f1", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "1-s2.0-S1071581922001070-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3105, "end": 6811}, "relationships": {"1": "0360fa08-30de-4a14-bd2e-37b1dd7b5ebd", "2": "ae43e4e3-f3a3-4038-893a-06ade7d1e7c3", "3": "8433a839-fc07-48ea-ac93-c6e8820c7979"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8433a839-fc07-48ea-ac93-c6e8820c7979": {"__data__": {"text": "icons require more \nresearch and the use of high-quality analytical tools like crowdsourcing \ncan help reduce the gap. \nBy combining different haptic technologies like vibrotactile and \nthermal, the available range of emotions evoked by the haptic stimula -\ntion can be enriched (e.g., Wilson & Brewster, 2017 ).

In its simplest form, \nhaptic stimulation can be used to create an illusion of physical \nco-presence while the actual emotions are mediated via visual stimula -\ntion (Tsetserukou & Neviarouskaya, 2012 ). Often, prosocial gestures \nlike hugs (Teh et al., 2009 ; Tsetserukou, 2010 ) are mimicked to evoke \npleasant affective experiences. \nSome of the earliest studies in the area of remote haptic communi -\ncation were focused on studying what could be communicated using \ntouch alone. Smith and MacLean (2007) instructed their participants to \ncommunicate emotions such as anger, delight, calmness, and joy to a \npartner with a 1-degree of freedom force-feedback knob. The results \nshowed the potential to communicate these emotions with a minimal \nhaptic device with a 54% accuracy. Bailenson et al. (2007) showed that \nwith a 2-degree of freedom force-feedback device the seven universal \nemotions (disgust, anger, sadness, joy, fear, interest, surprise) can be \nconveyed at above-chance level. Rantala et al. (2011) further showed \nthat vibrotactile stimulation can effectively mediate unpleasant, \npleasant, relaxed, and aroused intentions between two people when a \nmember of a dyad uses input gestures like squeezes and strokes, while \nthe other feels the vibrations in the palm area (Rantala et al., 2013b ). \nGestures like pinching, squeezing, and twisting (Simons et al., 2020 ) \nor poking (Park et al., 2011 ) can be successfully mediated to enhance the \ninteraction, with the most popular gesture being stroking. In a series of \nstudies, authors tested a haptic sleeve for remote communication \n(Huisman et al., 2016 ; Huisman et al., 2013 ) and showed that vibro -\ntactile stimulation on the arm can be perceived as a continuous stroking \nsensation like a gentle touch that activates CT-afferents. Other studies \nreport comparable results where a distant stroke can be perceived as \ncomfortable and like an actual caress (Eichhorn et al., 2008 ). Creating \nstroking gestures with vibrotactile actuators shows how CT touch (see R. Raisamo et al.

For example, studies have shown how strokes at low amplitude are \nfelt as pleasant and those with high amplitude are felt as unpleasant \n(Israr & Abnousi, 2018 ). Additional factors such as long duration and a \nshort inter-stimulus-interval maximize the feeling of continuation and \npleasantness (Culbertson et al., 2018 ). To promote the feeling of in-\ntimacy, other types of caressing gestures like touching fingers via haptic \ngloves can be used (e.g., Singhal et al., 2017 ). \nIn multimodal settings, touch can easily be used to highlight the \nemotional content of a story (Wang et al., 2012 ) or music (Chan et al., \n2019 ). There are also studies indicating people \u2019s preferences in using \nmultimodal settings to communicate emotions instead of haptics alone \n(Mullenbach et al., 2014 ). \nErk et al. (2015) showed how mediated affective touch can enhance \nprosocial behavior (e.g., understanding of the partner). Vibrotactile \nstimulation can facilitate social interactions for the visually impaired \nwhen a pattern shape or duration is varied to influence affective re-\nsponses (e.g., McDaniel et al., 2014 ). However, although thermal stim-\nulation relates to human emotions, its effects in mediated contexts do \nnot include elevation in prosocial behavior (Willemse et al., 2018 ). \nAs noted by Askari et al. (2020) , results related to mediated social \ntouch are mixed, and information about contextual factors potentially \naffecting the perception of mediated social touch and its affective \nqualities is virtually inexistent. Studies have also shown unambiguous \nevidence that comprehensive methodologies such as sociotechnical \nimaginary, which is a future-oriented method to connect social and \ntechnological orders (Jewitt et al., 2020a ) and research over touch \nnorms especially from gendered and cultural points-of-view (Jewitt \net al., 2020b ) could enrich designing haptic interfaces supporting \ninterpersonal touch. Furthermore, even though tactile sensations can be \nassociated with different emotions, there are only a few papers \naddressing comparisons between haptic technologies. Preliminary \nstudies indicate that force feedback is perceived as more natural than \nvibrotactile touch and has a better ability to express emotions (e.g., \nAhmed et al., 2016 ). \nDiscussion \nOur vision for the future is that haptics would provide as natural \ninterpersonal haptic communication channel as possible, both in the \nquality and the range of different stimuli produced. This high-quality \nhaptic communication channel should have low latency to allow real- \ntime haptic communication. We expect this type of haptics to be an \nessential building block of the metaverse where people would live and \nwork in the future. \nIn this Section, we first present nine emerging research themes based \non the present state of the art. Then, we discuss the societal impact and \nethical considerations related to wider availability, acceptance, and \nutilization of interpersonal haptic communication. \nEmerging research themes for the future \nThe following themes are based on the present state of the art and the \nauthors \u2019 views of the future trends in haptics.

Finally, we provide key research directions to \nadvance the theme. \nTheme 1: Mediated touch vs. non-mediated touch \nChallenge : To adapt mediated social touch technology (Huisman, \n2017 ) to the ways how humans use non-mediated touch in their daily \nlives.

The \nidentification of the key differences between mediated and non- \nmediated touch would give fruitful ground for applications, where the \nremote touch could be designed to better affect human emotions or \nenhance social bonds. Additional factors affecting the communication \nsetting include, for example, interpersonal distance and social norms \n(Askari et al., 2020 ). \nResearch gap: Mediated social touch is typically not recognized as \nsimilar to non-mediated touch (van Hattum et al., 2022 ; Askari et al., \n2020 ). Possible explanations for this include the incapability of current \nhaptic technology to realistically simulate a human touch and the lack of \nunderstanding of the wider setting where mediated social touch takes \nplace (Askari et al., 2020 ). Thus, more research is needed both related to \nthe used technological solutions as well as the social, perceptual, and \nother factors. \nKey Research Directions  \n\u2022Identify the underlying social, perceptual, and technological factors \nthat are essential for a tactile stimulus to be perceived as an inter-\npersonal touch.  \n\u2022Study the effects of the sender \u2019s or receiver \u2019s personality or current \nmood in the context of remote touch.  \n\u2022Study whether the effects of context are similar when the touch is \nmediated vs. non-mediated.  \n\u2022Investigate if social cues function similarly in real and mediated \ntouch settings. \nTheme 2: Combinations of haptic sub-modalities \nChallenge: To ensure haptic interpersonal communication can \nachieve an information transfer rate that is closer to visual and auditory \ncommunication, it is important to utilize all available haptic sub- \nmodalities. \nState: Numerous actuation technologies (see Section 3) and mate-\nrials (Biswas and Visell, 2019 ; Cruz et al., 2018 ) providing both tactile \n(Coe et al., 2019 ; Farooq et al., 2020 ; Evreinov et al., 2021 ) and kines -\nthetic output (Kim and Follmer, 2019 ; Elvitigala et al., 2022 ), have been \ndeveloped for skin stimulation controlled with physical parameters (e. \ng., displacement, acceleration, electrical current, pressure) (Farooq \net al., 2015 ). The studies that integrated more than one of these tech-\nnologies into a single haptic interface showed that this can improve \nsocial and affective responses to the distant touch (Farooq et al., 2016b , \nCoe et al., 2019 , Ahmed et al., 2016 ; Arafsha et al., 2015 ; Wilson & \nBrewster, 2017 ; Messerschmidt et al., 2022 ). Using a combination of \ntechnologies, we can ensure the resulting feedback can deliver a wider \nbandwidth of haptic information (Tan et al., 2010 ). \nResearch gap: The knowledge of combining haptic sub-modalities is \nunderdeveloped.

Previous research (see Section 4) has focused on using simple \nvibrotactile stimulation to amplify emotions evoked by visual or audi-\ntory content (Mazzoni and Bryan-Kinns, 2016b ). However, people prefer \nto communicate emotions multimodally (Mullenbach et al., 2014 ). Still, \nCT touch (McGlone & Reilly, 2010 ) is rarely addressed with the present \nhaptic technologies or studied in multisensory context (Toet et al., \n2011 ). \nResearch gap: Currently, there is a lack of understanding of the \npotential to use haptics in multisensory context beyond amplifying \nemotions conveyed via other modalities. Contextual factors (Askari \net al., 2020 ), the role of haptic sub-modalities like thermal stimulation \n(Ahmed et al., 2016 ; Willemse et al., 2018 ), and touch norms (Jewitt \net al., 2020b ) all contribute towards the perception of social or affective \nhaptics in multimodal context. \nKey Research Directions  \n\u2022Study the ability to reproduce CT touch (see Section 2.2) via haptic \ninterfaces.  \n\u2022Study the role and potential of haptic stimulation in multisensory \ncommunication where other sensorial information is provided in \nparallel.  \n\u2022Compare mediated touch in multisensory context to multisensory \ncommunication in real life. \nTheme 4: Wearable haptics and extended reality \nChallenge: To emotionally interpret haptic sensations on their body \nprovided by wearable systems, e.g., tickling sensations on their skin. \nInformative touch in the context of interpersonal communication via \nwearables should provide emotional connotations besides the physical \nsensations. \nState: Wearable haptics such as smart clothes are under active \nresearch. The most common body site remains the forearm to simulate \ncaress-like sensations (see Section 2.2). Vibrotactile handheld control -\nlers remain the dominant interaction method in current commercial VR \nsystems. Nonetheless, wearable haptic technologies are actively devel -\noped creating new opportunities for research to create haptic systems \nthat deliver sensations on the body. Companies such as HaptX, VRgluv, \nand more recently Meta Reality Labs have developed glove-based haptic \nsystems that can concurrently provide actuation and tracking. As an \nalternative to these glove-like exoskeletons, haptic vests and suits (e.g., \nTeslasuit) that provide haptic stimulation to multiple sites on the user\u2019s \nbody can be used to provide minimal and effective haptic feedback \n(Garc\u00eda-Valle et al., 2017 ; Krogmeier et al., 2019 ). \nResearch gap: The affective and emotional nature of the sensations \ndepends on the people engaging in the mediated tactile interaction and \naffects how they are felt on the body (see Section 4). Currently available \nhaptic stimuli have been found not to be able to articulate their meaning \nor connection to real touch (Jewitt et al., 2021 ). The experience is often \nrestricted to sensations or a different perceptual experience.

The situation of \ninitiating a mediated touch is different than using touch in a shared \nspace with another person. \nState : Gestural input and its related haptic output do not often match \nreal touch. Research should focus on interaction methods where haptic \ninputs match remote gestures triggered by another person (e.g., a haptic \nsleeve activated by remote stroking gestures). The sender \u2019s role is often \nmissing in remote communication studies even though it is easy to \nenvision how initiating touch is related to positive affect and social \nexperiences. Even in robotic interaction, humans use actual, tactile \ngestures with robots (Yohanan et al., 2005 ; Yohanan & MacLean, 2012 ). \nThis suggests a need for developing more expressive and realistic means \nfor distant touch input instead of limiting the initiation of touch to the \nuse of a surface, e.g., a touchscreen. \nResearch gap: There is a gap in understanding how different input \ndevices affect the sender \u2019s perception of initiated touch. There are \nstudies where touch-sensitive clothes or pieces of fabric (e.g., Huisman \net al., 2013 ) have been used as the platform for initiating touches. \nAdditional studies could focus on the role of artificial skin sensors in the \nuse of mediated social touch. Further research possibilities lie in \nstudying how the person initiating mediated touches perceives the \ncommunication setting. For example, when is it appropriate to initiate \ntouch contact so that the person receiving the touch does not get startled \nor surprised (van Hattum et al., 2022 )? Contextual factors (e.g., facial \nand verbal cues) can likely affect when and how touch is initiated. \nKey Research Directions  \n\u2022Explore the role of different touch sensing technologies on how \nmediated social touch is initiated.  \n\u2022Study the contextual and multisensory factors affecting the initiation \nof mediated social touch.  \n\u2022Investigate the sender \u2019s social and emotional responses during the \ncommunication and initiating touch. \nTheme 6: Haptic illusions \nChallenge: To make haptic communication more expressive by \nusing haptic illusions. This would contribute towards the potential to use \ncommon vibrotactile actuators in affective and social communication \n(see Section 4). \nState: Haptic illusions (Lederman & Jones, 2011 ) are still underu -\ntilized even though a growing body of research points towards the po-\ntential of creating motion-based sensations and distinguishing certain \nhaptic sensations as continuous or discontinuous to trigger some affec-\ntive responses (Ziat & Raisamo, 2017 ; Ziat et al., 2018 ). Special interest \nhas been given to suppression phenomena (Ziat et al., 2010 ) such as \napparent motion (Israr and Poupyrev, 2011 ) or the cutaneous-rabbit \nillusion, CRI (Gerald and Sherrick, 1972 ).

Two subsequent tactile stim-\nuli in two separate locations on the skin can be either felt as a continuous \nor a discontinuous motion. If both stimuli vibrate simultaneously, it can \nlead to a phenomenon known as tactile suppression where one stimulus \nis masked by another. Stimulus parameters such as duration, frequency, \nand amplitude (Raisamo et al., 2013 ) are a key combination for effective \nhaptic illusions. \nResearch gap: The research is limited to specific applications \ndetermining stimulus features to classify the motion-like illusions into \ncategories (e.g., apparent motion, saltation, suppression), with few \nstudies exploring the affective aspects of illusions. The pleasure \ndimension for tactile stimulation is often offset by visual stimulation \nwhile arousal and dominance can be modulated by the tactile stimula -\ntion (Ziat et al., 2020 ).

Haptic signals for \ninterpersonal communication can suffer from signal attenuation and \nintegration depending on environmental noise. This would not only \nguarantee high information transfer rate (Tan et al., 2010 ) but also \nprovide much needed reliability and intimacy. \nState: Tactile or kinesthetic feedback (see Section 3) is commonly \none component within a multimodal system (Laput et. al., 2015 ; Kim et. \nal., 2012 ). It is important to make all modalities of the system work \neffectively with each other (Zhaoyuan et. al., 2015 ). Instead of simply \nemphasizing on improving the efficiency of the actuation source (Hay-\nward et al., 2008 ) or enhancing the perceptual outcome of the created \nsignal (Umetani et al., 2016 ), current research (Farooq, 2017 ) focuses on \nimproving the entire haptic feedback loop: 1. how the source of the \nfeedback generates the intended signal (Evreinov et al., 2021 ), 2. How it \nis mediated within the device (Farooq et al., 2020 , Coe et al., 2019 ), and \n3. How to ensure signal integrity at the point of contact (Evreinov et al., \n2017 ; Pantera and Hudin, 2019 ) within the tactile sensitivity range. \nResearch gap: There are three key challenges with the current ap-\nproaches of providing haptic feedback: 1) inefficient delivery of the \nsignal, 2) static actuation, and 3) the lack of dynamic adjustment within \nthe system. Generated haptic signals are intended to propagate uni-\nformly, distributing the vibration energy across the entire device \nequally, but virtually no effort is made to ensure this (Basdogan et al., \n2020; Evreinov et al., 2017; Farooq et al., 2016a ). Actuators and driving \nmechanisms are coupled using performance parameters (i.e., resonance \nfrequency and displacement) rather than using the overall system ca-\npabilities, especially in multi-actuation setups (Dhiab and Hudin, 2019 ). \nThe lack of a viable feedback loop within the system means that stan-\ndardized haptic signals cannot be implemented across different devices \n(Hudin et al., 2015 ). \nKey Research Directions  \n\u2022Actively adjust the output of multiple actuation components with \nrespect to environmental noise and propagation inefficiencies.  \n\u2022Study the use of different surface materials to create more capable \nhaptic systems.  \n\u2022Use artificial intelligence methods to model interaction contexts and \nto modify haptic feedback parameters, creating a more robust end- \nto-end haptic communication channel. \nTheme 8: Contactless touch \nChallenge: To deliver expressive haptic information without phys-\nically touching a system. Contactless touch (see Section 3.4) is already \navailable, but much is still unknown of how to make it as expressive as \nother actuation technologies. \nState: Potential solutions exist, such as mid-air ultrasound haptics \n(Obrist et al., 2015 ), pneumatic haptics (Sodhi et al., 2013 ), magnetic \nhaptic effects (Ge et al., 2019 ), and thermal haptics (Salminen et al., \n2013 ). Despite existing technological obstacles, contactless haptic \nstimulation has been found to be effective in conveying social and \nemotional content (e.g., Obrist et", "doc_id": "b4ce660c-ac13-48ad-ae59-57b8af1930ce", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9fe2a0cb6212a5ce7da732a5734f0d4657e8ceb04857aef288f1a77078a2ae05", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "1-s2.0-S1071581922001070-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3741}, "relationships": {"1": "5f68212d-45a2-4220-9363-3ca4b95bd52f", "3": "3ecfc47f-ab31-4975-8028-6159a201f9cf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ecfc47f-ab31-4975-8028-6159a201f9cf": {"__data__": {"text": "feedback parameters, creating a more robust end- \nto-end haptic communication channel. \nTheme 8: Contactless touch \nChallenge: To deliver expressive haptic information without phys-\nically touching a system.

Despite existing technological obstacles, contactless haptic \nstimulation has been found to be effective in conveying social and \nemotional content (e.g., Obrist et al., 2015 ). It is necessary to investigate \nthese technologies as a part of multimodal communication scenarios and to study behavioral and emotional experiences related to stimulus \nperception. \nResearch gap: Existing solutions have technological limitations: \nResolution of thermal and mid-air haptics is often low, meaning that \nproviding accurate stimulation to a certain location of interaction is \ndifficult. Mid-air haptic devices typically require a stable distance be-\ntween the user and the device, while controlling the temperature \nchanges in a thermal device has a low temporal resolution (e.g., Sal-\nminen et al., 2011 ) and a magnetic device has a low spatial resolution. \nKey Research Directions  \n\u2022Increase the spatial and temporal resolution with the current \ntechnologies.  \n\u2022Create interaction methods that best suit for touchless haptic \ninteraction.  \n\u2022Investigate combinations of different contactless touch technologies \n(e.g., ultrasound and thermal haptics). \nTheme 9: Artificial skin \nChallenge: Human-like skin mesh can enhance communication in \nsocial interaction. Current embedded sensors require a trade-off be-\ntween technical capabilities, realistic interactive output, and the cost \nassociated with covering a large surface area of interaction. \nState: There is a wide range of approaches for designing artificial \nskin (Silvera-Tawil et al., 2015 , Tiwana et al., 2012 ). Force-sensing re-\nsistors are commonly used to sense touch (Akhtar et al., 2017 ) because \nof their accessibility and cost (Yeung et al., 1994 ). Resistive (Kli-\nmaszewski, et al., 2019 ) or piezo-resistive (Canavese et al., 2014 ) skin \nstructures have also been under development (Asfour et al., 2006 ; \nMukai et al., 2008 ). The latter are commonly ridged and create brittle \ntexture when embedded into artificial skin (Ulmen and Cutkosky, 2010 ; \nHonnet et al., 2020 ), resulting in a complex fabrication process with \nunnatural texture. One way to avoid this issue is to embed a soft cushion \nlayer (Fritzsche et al., 2011 ), or cover the sensing elements with textile \n(Tomo et al., 2018 ). Other sensors covered with silicone-based materials \ngive a more \u201cpleasant \u201d and human-like feel (Shirado et al., 2006 ; Minato \net al., 2007 ; Schmitz et al., 2011 ). Most of these techniques render the \nsensor mesh less efficient and in turn require forced touch, to register \neven subtle contact. \nResearch Gap: There is a need (Youssefi et al., 2014 ; Teyssier et al., \n2021 ) for artificial skin designs to follow the tradition of human-friendly \nartificial skin (O\u2019Neill et al., 2018 ) and adopt specific requirements for \nsensor implementation. Artificial skin and relevant sensor arrays can be \nimplemented by replicating the three main layers of the human skin: \nepidermis, hypodermis, and dermis.

For people suffering from dementia, whose \nhearing and visual abilities have been diminished, touch remains the \nonly bond to the external world by providing comfort and connections \nduring a disorienting or agitated behavior (Kim and Buschmann, 1999; \nViggo Hansen et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2017). \nInterpersonal haptic communication systems are particularly bene-\nficial for users with special needs, such as visual or hearing impairments. \nFor example, deafblind users rely heavily on touch in their communi -\ncation, and mediating touch over a distance would enable remote \ncommunication for them. In fact, early research in the field of haptics \nwas largely focused on sensory substitution systems for individuals with \nvisual and/or hearing impairment. Systems such as Tadoma (Reed et al., \n1996), Teletactor (Gault, 1927), Vibratese (Geldard, 1957), Optacon \n(Linvill & Bliss, 1966), TVSS (White et al., 1970), and Tactuator (Tan & \nRabinowitz, 1996) coded alphabetical and numerical information typi-\ncally received via the visual and auditory modalities to haptic stimula -\ntion. Due to the recent developments in wearable technologies, mobile \nhaptic aids can become more widely available. \nExamples of recent research include work on sound-to-touch sensory \nsubstitution systems that are designed to convert audio recorded from \nthe environment to vibrotactile stimulation presented with a vest \n(Novich & Eagleman, 2015). Neosensory Buzz is a commercial product \nthat uses the same principle to present audio from the environment to a \nhaptic band worn on the wrist. \nIn addition, the relationship to the toucher, cultural context, and \nother factors affecting tactile social interaction such as body area, \ngender, age and environments. To our knowledge, there has not been a \nthorough study related to touch throughout development from infancy \nto adulthood, passing through childhood and adolescence. Touch plays a \nvital role in child development (Frank, 1957). That said, there is a \nuniversal consensus that the older the child, the more funneled the \ntactile contact becomes with relatively small age variations based on the \nculture (Jones & Yarbrough, 1985). Kinships affect this dynamic even \nmore, determining the area on the body considered acceptable for touch \n(Suvilehto et al., 2015). In adulthood, touching the whole body is \nconsidered off-limits to most kinships, including parents. Touch by \nmothers extends to larger body areas than fathers are allowed to touch, \nwhile touch by a stranger is only limited to handshakes. Overall, the \nsocial bond correlated highly with the total body area being touched. \nThe stronger the bond the larger the area on the body (Suvilehto et al., \n2015). Even between partners, touch dynamics change whether they are \nin a private or public space. These known limitations for the use of touch \nare important also from a remote touch point of view: understanding the \ncontext and the relationship between the sender and receiver of the \ntouch is essential in order to evoke positive social experiences. \nFinally, environmental, and cultural factors play a role in proxemic \nbehavior. People living in cold areas such as Canada tend to have a \nlarger personal space than those living in warm areas such as the South \nAmerica. Dense populations such as India have lower expectations of \npersonal space (Duby, 1992). Additionally, Hall made a distinction be-\ntween high-contact cultures and noncontact cultures (Hall, 1966; Lustig \nand Koester, 1996). High-contact cultures are Latin American, Middle \nEastern and southern European, where hugging and kissing are often \ndaily interactions during conversations.

High-contact cultures are Latin American, Middle \nEastern and southern European, where hugging and kissing are often \ndaily interactions during conversations. These tactile demonstrations \nare less common or inexistent between North Americans, Northern Eu-\nropeans, and Asians during conversations (Mazur, 1977; H\u00f8gh-Olesen, \n2008) often limited to a handshake or a bowing. Such cultural differ -\nences will affect the uptake of different remote haptic technologies and \nshould be considered while designing haptic systems. Ethical Considerations \nEthical considerations related to emerging technologies is a hot topic \nespecially in the context of VR, cybernetics, and AI. With haptics, the \ndiscussion is almost nonexistent. As Boothroyd (2009) indicates, the \nethical attention to our digital and cyber spaces is focused mainly on the \nvisual dimension. The optimistic cheer for the potential of improving \nhuman lives while the pessimistic worry that these technological en-\nhancements would lead to invasive situations on both privacy and \npsychological levels. Moreover, due to their cost, access to emerging \ntechnologies would only be limited to an elite audience increasing hence \nthe gap of inequality within the society (Brenner, 2013). Haptic tech-\nnology faces the same challenges and considerations as other emerging \ntechnologies. \nPrivacy remains one of the most important values for humans when \nit comes to technology. Similar to a webcam that can be activated at \ndistance without the user\u2019s knowledge, a haptic device could be subject \nto hacking if it is connected through the internet. For instance, a device \ncan trigger vibrations or pressure when they are not needed or desired, \nor without the knowledge of the person being touched. Our phones \nalready vibrate, when we do not expect this, providing us with notifi -\ncations. We accept those vibrations and we do not consider them as a \nprivacy invasion. The context would be different if someone hacked your \nphone at a distance and triggered its vibrations without your consent. \nThe context used would be completely different if someone were con-\ntrolling a wearable haptic device on a part of your body. Birnbaum \n(2020) used the term \u201chaptic spam\u201d for situations where someone ac-\ntivates a haptic device without your permission. The worst-case situa-\ntion would be a rape per deception, where a person can forcibly control a \nsex toy at distance (Sparrow & Karas, 2020). \nThe invasive nature of some external devices to extend or modify \ntemporarily or permanently the human body begets some ethical, phil-\nosophical, and legal aspects about the nature of the invasion itself. The \nlegal terminology is blurred as pointed out in a case study by MacDon -\nald Glenn (2012), where an airline caused damage to a mobility assistive \ndevice (MAD) of an individual dependent on such system. The case was \nsolved by a compensation agreement where the passenger and the MAD \nwere perceived as a merged person. Despite being mostly out of the \nscope of the present article, similar problems will become more common \nif haptic technologies become interchangeable parts of the human \ncommunication abilities via human augmentation (Raisamo et al., \n2019).

Sensory restrictions enforced by the biomechanical structure of \nour skin and the mechanoreceptors therein may not be a limiting factor \nin the evolution of social touch. Concepts like cognitive touch, where the \nbrain is artificially stimulated to allow physical and virtual interaction \nmay become a future paradigm for tactile communication. \nAlthough haptic technology will provide us with new ways of \ncommunicating with each other, these shared experiences are highly \ndependent on the social contexts and can provide a framework for the \nethical issues raised above. The launch of the Metaverse space, where \nescapism (Han et al., 2022), harassment, and virtual groping (Falchuk, \nLoeb, & Neff, 2018) are growing, requires more research to establish \ndigital ethics guidelines. \nConclusions \nThe development of technology will allow better replication of real \ntouch which will improve the quality of mediated social touch. This will \nenable focus on finer details of interpersonal communication and make \nit possible to reach a deeper understanding of mediated social touch. The \nemerging themes presented are expected to have an impact on \nadvancing this field. Humans frequently use the sense of touch in their \ndaily lives to promote prosocial behavior, intimacy, and social bonding. \nConsequently, mediating social touch over a distance has gained a lot of \ninterest in the research community, but traditional vibrotactile stimu -\nlation methods are not optimal to convey either distinct, social, or R.

In the modern scenario, the combination of human senses \nwith field of computer science is becom ing more and more common. A detailed study of haptic technology is described in this \npaper which is entirely related to touch. The complete potential of the field is yet to be explored. The science of applying touch \nsensation and control to interact with computer developed applications is the best definition given for haptic technology. With the help of Haptic device people get a sense of touch with computer generated environments, so that when virtual objects are touched, they seem to be real and tangible.  Haptic technology enables the user to interface with a virtual environment via the \nsense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. This mechanical simulation helps in the creation of vi rtual \nobjects, controlling of virtual objects a nd to augment the remote control properties of machines and devices. This paper describes \nhow haptic technology works, its devices, applications, and disadvantages. A brief explanation on haptics functions and its implementation in various fields of study is provided in this paper. A description on some of its future applications and a few limitations of this technology is also provided.  \n \n\u00a9 201 7 Elsevier Ltd.

It deals with manipulation of surroundings and manual sensing through touch. The process of \ninteraction can be made by humans, machines, or a combination of both. Active touch means bidirectional \ninformation and energy flow between real (virtual environment) and the end user. To develop mental image of an \nobject, we need to grasp and manipulate the object. The measure of force exerted by the user on the interface is provided by haptic. On touching an object interactions are felt on the skin and these forces convey the information and lead to awareness of the physical world. When perception is received, the muscles are activated by brain whic h \nresults in the movement. Thus human haptics encircles to a closed loop between humans and the physical environment and all aspects related to sense of touch [6].\n \n \nMechanical, sensory, motor and cognitive components constitute the human haptic system. The mechanical \ncomponents include the body parts which work as per the brain retort. Sensory mechanism includes nervous system receptors, which gets activated when physical stimulus occurs and thus message is conveyed to brain. The cognitive mechanism include s the brain which analyses and perceives the conveyed information and then activates motor \ncomponents thereby completing the circle [13]. Machine haptics consists of several mechanical devices which come \nacross physical contact with humans for information sharing. The main of haptics is to assess forces on any part of \nthe body. Computer haptics consists of generating algorithms to create and touch the virtual atmosphere and objects. \nThe two important criteria are visual rendering and haptic rendering which indicate the exchange of information about virtual environment to the user. Haptic rendering includes software based on algorithms to find location of contact and also the forces between the user and the virtual environment [7]. Visual rendering is a process of \ngenerating algorithms to compute real time behaviour of virtual environment graphics. Multimedia haptics is the \nacquirement of data through human touch- sensory system and coordinating with other sensory displays in a \nmultimedia system which is also k nown as haptic audio visual environment (HAVE). It thus deals with harmonizing \nperformance of haptic data and other types of media in HAVE for tactile sensing and tactile sensing [7].  \n2. Working of Haptics  \nBasically a Haptic system consists of two parts namel y human part and the machine part. In the figure (1) Shown, \nleft part is human part and right part is machine part. The human part senses and controls the position of the hand \nand machine part exerts forces from the hand to simulate contact with a virtual object. Both the systems are provided with necessary sensors, processors and actuators. In the case of the human system, nerve receptors perform sensing, brain performs actuation of the motion performed by the hand. In the machine system, above mentioned f unctions \nare performed by the use of encoders, compute and motors respectively.  \nTo understand the basic working of haptics, consider the following diagram:  \n \nFig. 1.  Haptic system configuration [2].  \nThe controlling action of our body is done by brain. To different parts of the body it provides various instructions. The brain tells the muscles to give exact input to the end effectors. An end effector is a sensitive haptic device which is placed at the end of a robotic arm, designed to interact with the environment. It consist of various sensors which sense any change in the angle, force applied and conveys this information to the computer [12]. The device that puts something into an automatic action is known as actuators. Then onto the haptic device the actuator applies force, \n", "doc_id": "e8835da7-18cd-4a76-9b10-331098158f12", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "15f9836647fc95a6c1ab3eedf7636f606e7bc8f479dbe955283b10e14ff4d518", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4183", "file_name": "1-s2.0-S2214785317303188-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3987}, "relationships": {"1": "1f62a554-6fbb-4f24-a0ed-610f48d922b1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9d78b07-7f32-47c9-9afe-26efb017011c": {"__data__": {"text": "4184 Sreelakshmi M / Materials Today: Proceedings 4 (2017) 4182 \u20134187  \nwhich is considered as a feedback force by the user. On the skin the feedback force is felt and is then interpreted by \nthe brain. This refers to the basic working process of haptics. Haptics refers to two kind of information:  \n1) Kinesthetic information: refers to the information acquired by the sensors in the joint.   \n2) Tactile information: refers to the information acquired by the sensors connected to the user\u2019s body [5].   \nTypically a haptic system consist of   \n\uf06c Sensors  \n\uf06c Actuator control circuitry  \n\uf06c Actuators which vibrates or exerts force  \n\uf06c Real time algorithms and a haptic effect library  \n\uf06c Application programmable interface (API)  \n\uf06c Haptic effect authoring tool [14]  \n \nSpecialized hardware is used in haptics applications to provide sensory feedback. A common haptic interface \nconfiguration uses mechanical linkages to link a person\u2019s finger to computer interface. When the user\u2019s fingers \nmoves, the sensors translate those motions into actions on a  screen [15]. Thus motors transmit feedback through the \nlinkages to the fingers of the user. The process used by software to perform its calculation is called haptic rendering.  \n \nFig. 3.  Haptic rendering [5].  \nA. Haptic Devices  \nMechanical devices that mediate between the user and the computer are referred to as haptic devices. Haptic devices \nare input - output devices. They are able to track the user\u2019s physical manipulation which is input and provide realistic \ntouch sensations coordinated with the on \u2013  screen e vents as output.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4 .

For the visually impaired  \nAn integrated touch screen will be implemented in the haptic display device. Using this touch screen users can push \non areas of screen to activate menus and icons which they can feel there. The wide world of graphical information displays available on computers today can be accessed by blind people. The ability to display graphical images and \nactivating them by touch enables them to use these features. A multimodal tool allows blind people to create virtual \ngraphs independently. These multimodal interactions are provided by a low -cost haptic device. Touchable maps are \nalso developed for blinds using haptic technology [19].\n \n \nB.  Automotive  \nNowadays new car buyers want a separate climate control for the driver and front seat passenger and separate \ncontrols  in the rear. The problem arrives when more sophisticated the climate control system, more complex its \noperation. Many monitors fail to understand their systems. Haptic can make climate control systems easier to operate. Touch feedback can convey significa nt quantities of information. User doesn\u2019t need to be confined to \nsimple notifications. It is made easier by touch. The climate control system may be much more complex, but the touch feedback haptic makes it much easier. Reaction of humans towards touch is  immediate. So receiving \ninformation in this way improves the accuracy of user and speed and reduces the distractions. With the help of touch feedback guiding controls, users may not need to look at the controls. Thus it improves safety also [16].  \n \nC.  Vir tual education  \nMajority portion of people are kinaesthetic learners -they understand and catch up things easily when education \ninvolves movement and touch. From earlier times itself former education is focused on visual and auditory learning. A door to enti rely different learning method is opened up by haptics. Even for visual and auditory learners haptics \ncan improve learning. For a wide range of subject matter, by incorporating sensory data and feedback it allows for a \nricher understanding of concepts [18] . Both to teach concepts and to train students in different techniques haptic \ntools are used in variety of educational settings. Some faculties use haptic device to teach physics thus students can \nmanipulate and experience the physical properties of object s and the forces on them. In subjects such as biology and \nchemistry, virtual models of molecules and microscopic structures can be manipulated.\n \n D. Research  \nResearches have been done to simulate different kinds of tactitions by using high speed vibrations or other stimuli. \nOne such device of this type is a pad array of pins. The pins vibrate to simulate a surface being touched. This \nmethod doesn\u2019t provide any realistic feel. But it provides a useful feedback, allowing discrimination between \nvarious sizes, s hape.\n \n \nE.  Medicine  \nHaptic interfaces for medical simulation are useful for training of minimally invasive procedures (laparoscopy) and \nremote surgery using tele operators. The key advantage of this type is that the surgeon can perform many operations \nof the same type with less fatigue. Haptic interfaces are also used in rehabilitation robotics. Haptics is also used in \nophthalmology to remove cataracts [20].  \n \nF.  Arts and design  \nHaptics enables sculpting and virtual modelling. It is based on tactile feedbac k model. With the help of haptic \nfeedback and  touch virtual sculpting becomes easier.

Limitations  \nSome of the limitations of haptic technology are:  \n\uf06c Being a new technology it requires a very high initial investment and hence costly.  \n\uf06c Haptic devices are bulky, large in size and greater in length. Thus become problems for wearable haptic \ndevice.  \n\uf06c Haptic interface exerts force with limited magnitude and unequal in all directions. Haptic rendering \nalgorithm operates in discrete time whereas real time users operate in continuous time.  \n\uf06c Bandwidth limitation is another limitation. Limited bandwidth is allotted for data transmission. Haptic data \nis heavy and usually requires greater bandwidth. If the required bandwidth is not available, it may lead to \nwrong interpretation.  \n\uf06c Universal operability of haptic interfaces: for specific applications specific haptic interfaces are developed. \nFor every new task, new implementation is required. These adaptations can be boring. Thus a uniform \nuniversally ac cepted interface is required.  \n\uf06c Instability and vibration: The update rate of graphic rendering is 60Hz. But haptic rendering rate must be of \n100Hz.it leads to instability if required rates are not met. Thus system becomes unstable [17].  \n5. Future Applications  \nA. Holographic Interaction  \nResearches are carried on to combine haptic technology with holographic projection. By this feedback, user receives \nresponse from hologram. It is based on ultrasound waves. Through tactile response the user perceives th e object  \n \nB. Biometric Haptics  \nBiometrics also uses haptics. A unique ID and password is used for conventional biometrics. Hence to remember \nthese password and ID is difficult thus less secure. This can be easily hacked. The haptic based biometric system \nmeas ures the position, velocity and force and thus unique physical patterns are developed which are used for \nidentification.  \n \nC. E- Commerce  \nBy using haptic device in electronic commerce, consumers are able to physically interact with the commodity. By \ntouching t he product can be felt and its texture and roughness can be determined.  \n \nD. Education  \nVisualisation of geometric problems can be done in actual 3 -D space. Thus a better and clear understanding of \nproblem can be achieved.  \n6. Conclusion  \nHaptics is still in its beg inning stage. It has immense potential within it to bring about a drastic change in \ncommunication filed. However it has few limitations relates to its hardware, cost and its implementation. Haptics is \nfinding its application in every field such as educatio n, entertainment, art, medical etc. Development of various \nkinds of haptic interfaces is continuing, which provides more lifelike interactions with the virtual objects and virtual environment. Advancement in hardware will provide more opportunities to prod uce haptic devices in smaller \npackages. Consumer grade haptic devices have already arrived in the market. Haptic is the future for online \ncomputing and e -commerce. It will enhance the shopper experience and thus help online shoppers to feel \nmerchandise wit hout leaving their homes. Because of this increasing need for haptic applications, the cost of haptic \ndevices will surely drop in future. Haptics will soon be a part of a person\u2019s normal computer interaction.\n \nReferences  \n[1] Amin , M. M.; Zaman, H.

We successfully use our hands to identify\nobjects and to extract a wealth of information about them, such as their surface texture, compliance, weight, shape, size, orientation, and\nthermal properties. We demonstrate impressive manual dexterity when reaching for, grasping, and subsequently manipulating objects within\narm's reach. Manualgestures, such as those used in sign l anguage and \ufb01nger spelling, collectively offer valuable forms of communication to\nthose who are deaf or hearing impaired. In addition, raised tangible graphic displays that are explored by hand provide sensory aids to theblind when planning how to navigate their environment without a sighted companion. Finally, the human hand serves as a formidable creativetool in a variety of aesthetic milieus that include dance, sculpture, playing music, and drawing. Depictions of the human hand in art date backto the Upper Paleolithic era (circa 22,000 \u201328,000 years ago) and can stil lbe seen today in caves at Gargas and ElCastil l o in the Franco-\nCantabrian region (Napier, 1993; Piveteau, 1991). There is even a museum dedicated speci \ufb01cally to the hand (La Mus\u00e9e de la Main), which was\nestablished by Claude Verdan, a Swiss hand surgeon, in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nHistorical Roots\nNot surprisingly, the study of human hand function derives its historical roots from multiple sources. From archaeology come the verydetailed analyses of the changes in the anatomy and structure of the hand as it gradually evolved and became capable of using and, moreimportant, manufacturing tools (Marzke & Marzke, 2000). Zoological and anthropological studies have also focused on the structural aspectsof the hand, although this work has primarily concentrated on the functional use of the hand by various primate species, including Homosapiens\n(Preuschoft & Chivers, 1993). Consideration of these phylogenetic and ontogenetic changes in primate and human hands has led researchers,\nparticularly during the latter half of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century, to examine how such changes relate to the\ndevelopment of human hand function over the lifespan.", "doc_id": "fb0a71b2-0bc0-4976-92bf-3875e5f2c329", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "34d49460badd77e28142de483b7cd2474e9accfe139f9377006754deeeebf60a", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2384}, "relationships": {"1": "01a931f5-aa01-4daf-8cb1-b7f0416ee336"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aab3f79-dc0a-46a2-a322-27b6782cf439": {"__data__": {"text": "Philosophers and, more recently , experimental psychologists have been interested in the sense of touch for centuries, although their attention\ndid not focus on manual sensing per se. As early as Aristotle, those interested in touch recognized that this sensory modality was indeed\ndifferent from the others (i.e., vision, audition, taste, and smell), a perspective that was maintained throughout the 19th century by individualssuch as Weber (1834/1978), Blix (1884), Goldscheider (1886), and Frey (1896).\nTwo particularly noteworthy developments of the 19th century that have proved to be of signi \ufb01cant value to those who study hand function\ntoday derive from the work of Weber and, subsequently, Gustav Fechner. It was Weber (1834/1978) who \ufb01rst introduced quantitative\ntechniques to the study of sensory physiology by measuring both absolute and differential thresholds. He also documented a mathematicalrelation between the size of the change in stimulus magnitude and the just noticeable difference in perceived intensity, which came to be\nknown as Weber's law . Fechner (1860/1966), both a physicist and a philosopher, was interested in offering an alternate interpretation, monism,\nto Descartes' mind-body dualism. To do so, he argued that the relation between mental and physical events could be described by a generalquantitative \u201cpsychophysicall aw \u201dthat assumed that all just noticeable differences are subjectively equal and that Weber's law is true. Toward\nthis end, he developed several classical psychophysical methods for measuring sensory thresholds, all of which remain in common use today.\nEarly tactile concerns centered on issues related to determining the appropriate number of human sensory modalities and submodalities and to\nthe varying sensitivity and spatialacuity of the skin across the entire human body when stimul ated by mechanicaland thermalforms of energy.During the 19th century, anatomists whose names are well known today (e.g., Meissner, Pacini, Krause) showed much interest in using the newhistological techniques of their day to identify the various receptors within the skin. The results of such studies served as the basis for\naddressing a third important issue, namely, the links between the receptor populations known at that time and the speci \ufb01c human cutaneous\nsensibility (or sensibilities) that each served. Although the hand was frequently included as a site of stimulation, it was only one among many.\nWeber (1834/1978) \ufb01rst introduced the well-known two-point touch threshold as a measure of the skin's spatial acuity, a measure that has\nsubsequently become an important, albeit highly controversial, measure of human hand function. He de \ufb01ned the two-point threshold as the\nshortest distance between two contact points that could be perceived as two separate contacts, as opposed to just one. Weber made extensivemeasurements of tactile acuity using his own body and that of his brother. In his work, Weber initially employed an instrument known as thebeam compass (or beam trammel), which consisted of a beam with two adjustable connectors that held two steel or pencil points in place atright angles to the beam. To avoid damage to the skin, these points were further enclosed in cork stoppers borrowed from medicine bottles.\nEventually , Weber switched to using a pair of metal compasses to stimulate the skin. The two points were applied to many places on the body,\nincluding the dorsal and volar regions of the palm and \ufb01ngers.

The German physiologist Max von Frey\n(1896) invented two instruments that were used to study pressure sensitivity and the location of \u201ctouch\u201dspots on the skin. One device, the\nlimen gauge, was capable of applying force to the skin at any predetermined rate of loading. The other comprised a graduated series of horseand human hairs that were mounted in the ends of sticks and used to measure pressure thresholds (Boring, 1942). These instruments have\nbeen employed extensively in studies of pressure sensitivity on the hand over the past 100 years. Indeed, a variant of the von Frey hairs (the\nSemmes-Weinstein mono \ufb01laments) is still in use today.\nMuch of this early sensory research focused on the tactile sensitivity of a passive subject; however, there was also considerable interest at the\nsame time in understanding the perception of weight (Weber, 1834/1978) and other aspects of what was called the \u201cmuscular sense. \u201dThis\nterm fell into disuse in the early 20th century and was replaced by proprioception, a term coined by Sherrington (1906), and kinesthesis, aconcept introduced by Bastian (1887).4 HistoricalOverview and GeneralIntroduction", "doc_id": "ea936ab0-014e-46a3-b475-264b0e22fb7a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d68745ac2cc537b3cb21aa48cc35b678b426e05c3c8de82d7ee7baac79f049ef", "extra_info": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3105, "end": 4978}, "relationships": {"1": "c03c18ca-570d-448f-9893-3924b78783ca", "2": "8aab3f79-dc0a-46a2-a322-27b6782cf439"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aab6dec-5976-472c-89fd-1ca8336ae471": {"__data__": {"text": "Proprioception was de \ufb01ned as the sense subserved by receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints and in the labyrinth, part of the vestibular\napparatus. The concept of kinesthesis included sensory information arising from receptors in the skin, muscles, and other deep structures of\nthe limbs, such as tendons and joints. Bell (1826) was the \ufb01rst to postulate the existence of the muscular sense, which he considered to be at\nparity with the other senses. That is, he regarded it as a sixth sense, although he did not think that muscles were the exclusive site of peripheralsensations (Sherrington, 1900a). The muscular sense was considered to include three classes of sensations: pain and fatigue, weight andresistance, and movement and position. In his 1833 treatise on the hand, Bell noted that \u201cwithout a sense of muscular action or a\nconsciousness of the degree of effort made, the proper sense of touch could hardly be an inlet to knowledge at all. \u201d(p.193). He argued that\nboth muscle and cutaneous sensations must be involved in perceiving the distance, size, form, weight, hardness, and roughness of objects.\nThis indicates a very early recognition of the functional role played by sensors in the skin and muscles in what is now called active haptic\nprocessing. These ideas were elaborated further by Sherrington (1900b) in his chapter on cutaneous sensations in Sh\u00e4fer's TextbookofPhysiology.\nIn this chapter, Sherrington made the important distinction between active touch, in which the touch sense is related to a series of \u201cmuscular\nsensations, \u201dand passive touch, in which an object is allowed to move over a series of tactual points (Phillips, 1986).\nThe origin of sensations governing the awareness of the forces generated during muscular contractions was fervently debated during the latter\npart of the 19th century (e.g., Bastian, 1887; Lewes, 1879). In these discussions, a distinction was made between sensations arising in the\nperiphery and sensations of innervation, which were of central origin. Many physiologists and psychologists of the period, including Helmholtz\nand Wundt, believed that innervation of the motor tracts during voluntary movements produced sensations within the brain. These sensations\nof innervation were thought to form the basis of the awareness of muscle force and were called a sense of effort. The idea of sensations of\ninnervation declined in popularity, however, with Bastian, Ferrier, and Sherrington all supporting Bell's concept of the muscular sense with itsemphasis on peripheral sensations. The notion that internally generated motor signals might have perceptual consequences did, however,reemerge in the 20th century with the work of Sperry (1950) and Holst (1954), who used the terms corollary discharges and efference copy,respectively , to describe internal signals that arose from centrifugal motor commands and that in \ufb02uenced perception.\nFrom the perspective of human hand function, studies of the muscular sense elucidated two important \ufb01ndings. First, in his research on\nweight perception, Weber (1834/1978) observed, as was subsequently con \ufb01rmed by other investigators (e.g., Ferrier, 1886), that although\nweight discrimination is precise with touch alone (i.e., tactile sensing), it is always more exact if the weight is lifted by the hand (i.e., active\nhaptic sensing). The ability to discriminate between weights of different mass by voluntary muscular exertion was termed a sense of force\n(Frey, 1914) and was considered one of the essential elements of the muscular sense. The second observation relates to the degree of\nsensitivity of different joints in the hand and arm in detecting movements. In 1889, Goldscheider published the results from a series of\ncarefully executed experiments in which he measured the movement detection", "doc_id": "9aab6dec-5976-472c-89fd-1ca8336ae471", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "41738b037a4b651ead68ffe61566515596c2dfb28b5b1320ef71e1084dc8ef9b", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3805}, "relationships": {"1": "bbf79de6-23b2-4600-a18a-0a536a08fc49", "3": "ae602605-3f49-4bef-9c3b-8b98fbc82f2e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae602605-3f49-4bef-9c3b-8b98fbc82f2e": {"__data__": {"text": "perception, Weber (1834/1978) observed, as was subsequently con \ufb01rmed by other investigators (e.g., Ferrier, 1886), that although\nweight discrimination is precise with touch alone (i.e., tactile sensing), it is always more exact if the weight is lifted by the hand (i.e., active\nhaptic sensing).

The second observation relates to the degree of\nsensitivity of different joints in the hand and arm in detecting movements. In 1889, Goldscheider published the results from a series of\ncarefully executed experiments in which he measured the movement detection thresholds for various joints while attempting to excludecutaneous sensations of pressure as much as possible. He found that the thresholds for detecting both active and passive movements weremuch smaller for more proximal joints, such as the shoulder, as compared to the distal \ufb01nger joints. This proved especially true for slower\nmovements. In interpreting these \ufb01ndings, he noted that the speed of natural movements of a joint is related to the lever arm over which that\njoint acts; hence, slower movements are more characteristic of proximal rather than distal joints. Goldscheider's results also showed that there\nis a well-developed capacity to detect movements passively imposed on the limbs, and so it seemed unnecessary to resort to a concept of\nsensations of innervation to explain movement perception.\nFollowing the more common examples set by 19th-century investigators interested in internal tactile sensations as opposed to those interested\nin muscular sensations, the study of touch in the \ufb01rst half of the 20th century focused primarily on tactile sensing by passive (stationary)\nobservers (Boring, 1942; Geldard, 1972).

In keeping\nwith Fechner's signi \ufb01cant move away from the dualistic mindbody philosophy of Descartes, these researchers also began to explore the\nfunctional relation between numerically assessed sensory magnitudes of perceptual events and their corresponding physical magnitudes. Inaddition to this behavioral approach, which used psychophysical methodologies, neurophysiologists began to uncover correspondingrelationships between the magnitude of the neural activity of cutaneous \ufb01bers in nonhuman observers (usually primates) and the\ncorresponding magnitude of the physical stimulus (e.g.. Werner & Mountcastle, 1965). Although not the focus of the current book, the studyof nonhuman primates has also contributed signi \ufb01cantly to our knowledge of how the brain controls the hand.\nDuring the early to mid-20th century, only three individuals \u2014David Katz (1925/1989). Geza R\u00e9v\u00e9sz (1950), and James J. Gibson (1962.\n1966)\u2014stand out for their uncommon emphasis on the critical importance of active, voluntary manual exploration. The focus of their\nresearch was on the perception and recognition of externalobjects and their physicalproperties rather than on subjective internaltactil esensations. Katz offered a wealth of fascinating and critical observations regarding the sense of touch and how it functions, both incomparison to and in concert with vision and audition. He regarded the hand, as opposed to the skin with its atomistic tactile receptors, as theprimary organ for touch. His comprehensive work on the perception of texture, or microstructure, is truly impressive and offers a strikingcontrast to the historically more common focus on shape, or macrostructure. For example. R\u00e9v\u00e9sz was particularly interested in form\nperception by hand as opposed to by eye and to this end proposed a previously unrecognized tactual mode of experience known as haptics.\nUsing his background in philosophy and aesthetics, he offered a theory of haptic form perception, which in turn led him to carefully observe\nblind individuals as they manually appreciated or created three-dimensional sculptures. He questioned the possibility that the blind can ever\npossess a meaningful aesthetic appreciation of plastic works of art. an issue we will revisit later. J. J. Gibson continued the pioneering work ofKatz and R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, highlighting the fact that hands are used to explore and to alter the environment, thus serving both perceptive and executivefunctions simultaneously. He too critically emphasized the importance of the hand and the haptic system for actively gathering informationabout the external world. As the works of these three individuals have become better known, particularly those of Gibson, they have led to asurge of scienti \ufb01c and applied interest in haptic sensing as formally de \ufb01ned below , since the early 1990s.\nThere is a parallel and complementary evolution of research that focuses on the natural actions of the hand. As described above, much of the\nearly experimental research in the motor \ufb01eld focused on the muscular sense.

Similar\nobservations had in fact been made by Munk (1909). who described the learning that occurred in monkeys following unilateral deafferentation.provided that their normal limbs were bound. These animals were trained to open and close their hands, to grip, and to produce a variety ofmovements with their deafferented arms.\nDuring this period in which the focus of motor research was on re \ufb02ex pathways, there are isolated examples of studies on human movements,\nsuch as Bryan and Harter's (1899) analysis of the performance6 HistoricalOverview and GeneralIntroduction", "doc_id": "13b08acd-c295-4b52-a778-df110ce5a62d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3da8c767fe9618422cae2efbc680e84eddde70243fa1a210431a07d375107d00", "extra_info": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3151, "end": 5031}, "relationships": {"1": "b7b78511-92cb-48ff-9779-d1adf3e2441f", "2": "4b85f8a8-5e5a-4375-bead-47895b29abf5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "65abf8ca-f01a-4c25-a6f5-3251448ce22d": {"__data__": {"text": "of Morse code operators and the improvement in their skills with training and Woodworth's (1899) and Hollingworth's (1909) monographs on\nthe accuracy of voluntary arm movements.

For much of the 20th century, the study of human hand function was\nlimited to the analysis of simple movements similar to those studied by Woodworth. although there were some notable exceptions, such asBernstein and his colleagues, who started their analysis of movements using tasks such as hammering a nail and striking piano keys (Bernstein.1967). By the later part of the 20th century, an emphasis on more natural movements emerged, in part stimulated by new methods that\nenabled the measurement of the kinematic and dynamic features of tasks, such as pointing (Georgopoulos.

The goal of\nthis research is to design and build haptic and multisensory interfaces for remotely exploring and manipulating virtual and real worlds.

For example, software designers who are interested in haptically rendering objects and their properties (e.g.. shape, size, surface texture, and compliance) in a virtual environment must deliver the types of tactile and haptic cues that the human usercan use effectively . This holds true as well for teleoperator systems that deliver information to the hand(s) of a user who must interact with andact upon a realremote environment, as in the case of performing tel erobotic repairs in space.\nA New Conceptual Framework for Human Hand Function\nThe framework that we have adopted in this book conceptualizes hand function along a continuum that ranges from activities that areessentially sensory in nature to those that have a strong motor component. Within this sensorimotor continuum, we delineate four categoriesin detail, as listed in \ufb01gure 1.1.

The differences between modern human and nonhuman primate hands are discussed with particular reference to tool use and\nmanufacture. We then review the basic anatomy of the human hand as re \ufb02ected in its bones, joints, muscles, and the structure of the skin\nsurface. The sensory and motor innervation of the muscles and skin is described, and \ufb01nally we conclude with a brief summary of some of the\nbiomechanical models of the hand that have been developed.\nEvolutionary Development of the Hand\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, there are three major developments in the structure and function of the hand as it evolved from a supportstructure for locomotion to an organ devoted to manipulation. First, there is the development of the pentadactyl ( \ufb01ve-\ufb01ngered) hand with\nenhanced mobility of the digits, as compared to its predecessors. Second, claws thinned and moved dorsally to become \ufb02at nails and so no\nlonger provided assistance in holding the body when climbing; this was now accomplished by \ufb02exing the digits around a branch or by grasping\na branch between the digits (Schultz, 1969). Finally, there is the development of highly sensitive tactile pads on the volar (palmar) surface of the\ndigits (LeGros-Clark, 1959). In spite of these advances, the hands of primates have remained primitive in their skeletal structure; indeed, the\nprimate hand is considered to be more primitive than the foot, face, shoulder, knee, or hip (Napier, 1976). The pentadactyl hand has been\ntermed \u201cthe absolute bedrock of mammalian primitiveness \u201d(Wood-Jones, 1944, p. 19), as it was established more than 350 million years ago\n(Mya) in the Devonian period (see \ufb01gure 2.1) and is seen in the fossill obe \ufb01n\ufb01shEusthenopteron (Kemble, 1987; Marzke, 1992). The phalangeal\nstructure of 2 \u20133\u20133\u20133\u20133 has also been a mammalian characteristic since the beginning of the Tertiary period (65 Mya), and the only change in\nthe structure of the human hand from this ancient scheme is the absence of the os centrale, a small bone of the carpus (wrist) which has fusedwith the adjacent scaphoid bone as shown in \ufb01gure\ufb01ngered) hand with enhanced mobility of the digits, as compared to its predecessors.\nSecond, claws thinned and moved dorsally to become \ufb02at nails and so no longer provided assistance in holding the body when climbing; this\nwas now accomplished by \ufb02exing the digits around a branch or by grasping a branch between the digits (Schultz, 1969).

Opposition involves \ufb02exion, abduction, and medial\nrotation of the thumb so that the pulp surface can make contact with the terminal phalanges of one or all of the remaining digits. The\narticulation of the thumb metacarpal (the proximal bone of the thumb) and the trapezium (a bone of the wrist), in what is known as a saddle\njoint, enables the thumb to rotate 45 \u00b0around its longitudinal axis. This movement of opposition is essential for effective handling and\nexploration of small objects and greatly facilitated primate tool use and construction. Not all primates have an opposable thumb; only OldWorld monkeys and apes are capable of rotating the thumb, and some primates, such as the colobus and spider monkey, are thumbless\n(Napier, 1993). The spider monkey compensates for its lack of manual dexterity by using its prehensile tail to pick up small objects. This is\npossible because the skin on the underside of the distal one third of its tail is hairless and is similar in function to the papillary skin on the hand.Although opposition of the thumb is evident in many Old World monkeys and apes (Napier & Napier, 1985), the extensive area of contactbetween the compressible pulps of the thumb and index \ufb01nger is a unique human characteristic, as the thumb is positioned more distally and is\nlonger relative to the index \ufb01nger in human as compared to nonhuman primates (Napier, 1961). In addition, human hands are distinctive in\nthe relative mass of the thumb musculature, which makes up about 39% of the weight of the intrinsic muscles within the hand, as compared to\n33% in gibbons and 24% in chimpanzees and orangutans (Tuttle, 1969). Figure 2.2 illustrates various primate hands, including those of the\nthree larger apes most closely related to humans, namely, the orangutan ( Pongo ), gorilla, and chimpanzee ( Pan). For these primates, the \ufb01ngers\nare so long relative to the thumb that manipulation typically involves the thumb with the lateral surface of the index \ufb01nger rather than with the\ntips of the \ufb01ngers (Marzke, 1992).\nIn the human hand, unlike those of other primates, the distal phalanges have rough horseshoeshaped tuberosities (see \ufb01gure 2.3) to which the\nsoft tissues of the palmar pads are attached. These pads distribute pressure during grasping and allow the \ufb01ngertips to conform to uneven\nsurfaces (Napier, 1976; Young, 2003). The pad on the volar surface of the distal phalanx of the thumb is broader in humans than in other\nprimates and is distinctive in that it is divided into two wedged-shaped compartments. This permits forces that are applied to the \ufb01ngerpad to\nbe dissipated more evenly . The proximal compartment is more deformable and mobile than the distal compartment, which allows the softtissue to mold around an object so that it is held against the distal pulp (Shrewsbury & Johnson, 1983). The tip pinch between the pads of the\nthumb and index \ufb01nger that is used to pick up very small objects appears to be a unique human characteristic and is possible because of the\nhuman ability to hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index \ufb01nger passively .

In many nonhuman primate species, the \ufb01ngers must be \ufb02exed in\norder for the tips to meet the tip of the thumb, due to the considerably longer \ufb01nger lengths relative to that of the thumb, as can be seen in\n\ufb01gure 2.2 (Marzke, 1992).\nA number of indices derived from the relative projections of various parts of the hand have been used to characterize the structure of different\nprimate hands (Napier & Napier, 1967). These measures, and in particular the opposability index, which expresses the ratio between thelengths of the thumb and index \ufb01nger (100(total length of thumb/total length of index \ufb01nger)), have proven usefulin characterizing the\nmanipulative capacity of different hands. As the lengths of the index \ufb01nger and thumb become more similar, the opposability index increases.\nInHomosapiens , this ratio is 60, in the baboon 57 \u201358 (Papio in\ufb01gure 2.2), but in the orangutan ( Pongo in\ufb01gure 2.2) only 40 (Napier, 1993;\nSchultz, 1956). The baboon has a high ratio because its \ufb01ngers are short relative to the metacarpals, presumably as part of its adaptation to\nterrestrial digitigrade locomotion. When it walks, the palmar surfaces of its phalanges make contact with the ground and the metacarpals are\nhyperextended (Marzke, 1992). Arborealprimates, such as the orangutan and chimpanzee ( Pongo andPan, respectively, in \ufb01gure 2.2), have\ntended to develop a prehensile forelimb for locomotion from tree to tree, at the expense of having pulp-to-pulp contact between the thumband other \ufb01ngers (Kemble, 1987).

The discovery in 1960 in the Olduvai Gorge of 1.75 million-year-old fossil hand bones from an\nearly human ancestor ( Homohabilis ) at the same level as primitive stone tools led to a debate that has continued for more than 40 years on the\nrole of tools in the evolution of the human hand (Marzke & Marzke, 2000). The manufacture of speci \ufb01c tools was preceded by a period of\nunmodi \ufb01ed tooluse in which objects found in the environment, such as stones, bones, or pieces of wood, were used for obtaining food or\nproviding protection. It seems likely that tool use, which is evident in many animals, including primates, was followed by a period in whichtools were modi \ufb01ed or adapted to improve their performance. This type of behavior is evident in present-day chimpanzees, who \u201c\ufb01sh\u201dfor\ntermites by poking long slender twigs down \ufb02ight holes to a termite nest and then retracting the twig that is now covered in termites.\nChimpanzees have been observed collecting twigs prior to arriving at a termite nest and removing any small offshoots or branches that would\nimpede the twig'sEvolutionary Development and Anatomy of the Hand 13", "doc_id": "01a3910a-4e7d-44aa-bc7d-982b0b75bf63", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "91fa5d84a9add71b0a097e6c5cec2f217f15aad40f69220c260da9352273f3d8", "extra_info": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1633}, "relationships": {"1": "4ed4fba9-6abc-4870-bf43-9f5b406e40bc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e45a92a-1ee1-4d90-bc5e-a6a48a4fef02": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 2.3.

From toolmodi \ufb01cation came toolmanufacture, in which objects occurring natural l y in the\nenvironment (stones) were transformed into tools (hand axes) that had a speci \ufb01c purpose. This \ufb01nalstage required the intel l ectualcapacity for\nconceptual thought and is considered to have taken more than 1 million years to emerge in tool users (Wiesendanger, 1999).\nIt is from analyses of fossil hands associated with various prehistoric tools that an understanding has arisen of how these tools were made and\nwhich species were capable of making them. It appears that a primitive tool culture existed at least 2 million years ago in Tanzania and thatHomohabilis was capable of fashioning stones into useful shapes (Leakey & Lewin, 1977). Studies of contemporary stone tool-making behavior\nin both human (New Guinea stone toolmakers) and nonhuman primates revealthe patterns of hand use required to make different types of\ntools. They indicate that a number of precision grips are used in tool manufacture, but that a \ufb01ne precision grip between the tips of the thumb\nand index \ufb01nger is not essential(Marzke, 1997).\nAnatomy of the Hand\nThe basic structure of the human hand can be considered in terms of its bones and associated joints, muscles, and skin. Standard terminology\nis used to refer to the various digits and parts of the hand as shown in \ufb01gure 2.4. The hand has a dorsalsurface, a vol ar or pal mar surface, and\nradial and ulnar borders. The palm of the hand is divided into three regions: the thenar mass or eminence that overlies the thumb metacarpal,\nthe midpalm area, and the hypothenar mass that overlies the metacarpal of the little \ufb01nger.\nBones and Joints\nThere are 27 bones in the hand, with 8 carpalbones constituting the wrist, 5 metacarpalbones in the pal m, and 14 phal angealbones that make\nup the digits (2 in the thumb and 3 in each \ufb01nger). The carpalbones are arranged in two rows, with the more proximalrow articul ating with\nthe radius and ulna in the forearm. The proximal row comprises the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform, and the distal row, whicharticulates with the metacarpals, comprises the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate. The metacarpal bones in the palm of the handarticulate closely with the adjacent carpal bones in the distal row, and these carpometacarpal joints are capable of \ufb02exion/extension\nmovements and radialand ul nar deviation. With the exception of the \ufb01rst metacarpalof the thumb, independent motion of these joints is very\nlimited, but the range of movement increases14 Evolutionary Development and Anatomy of the Hand", "doc_id": "5e45a92a-1ee1-4d90-bc5e-a6a48a4fef02", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e418eda5a382fd2c39461c4ff5c63cdd3399e5b488b4b6472c2c1ea121971fe6", "extra_info": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2832}, "relationships": {"1": "c046882b-d861-4e39-923f-0c0a0bd5a1da"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "252954c4-d1ea-4010-b976-b6df683d3fc4": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 2.4.

The \ufb01ve meta-carpophalangeal joints (biaxial or condyloid\ntype) are universal or saddle joints capable of both \ufb02exion/extension and abduction/adduction movements (movements away from and\ntoward the midline of the hand), whereas the nine interphalangeal joints in the digits are hinge joints capable of only \ufb02exion and extension. The\nthree bones in the \ufb01ngers are known as the proximal, middle, and distal phalanges, and each \ufb01nger has three joints, the metacarpophalangeal\n(MP), the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints.\nThe totalactive range of motion of a typical \ufb01nger is 260 \u00b0, which is the sum of active \ufb02exion at the MP (85 \u00b0), PIP (110 \u00b0), and DIP (65 \u00b0) joints\n(American Society for Surgery of the Hand, 1983). The range of active extension at the MP joint varies between people but can reach 30 \u201340\u00b0\n(Kapandji, 1970). Passive and active \ufb02exion of the MP joint increases linearly from the index to the little \ufb01nger, and the totalactive range of\nmotion of the \ufb01ngers also increases from the index to the little \ufb01nger (Mallon, Brown, & Nunley, 1991). Although there is no passive extension\nbeyond 0 \u00b0at the PIP joint, at 30 \u00b0it is appreciable at the DIP joint, a uniquely human feature, as noted previously.

The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is described by many authors as a saddle joint with two degrees of freedom.\nAlthough there is considerable axial rotation in addition to \ufb02exion/extension and abduction/adduction movements, this is constrained and so\nit is not considered a true third degree of freedom (Cooney, Lucca, Chao, & Linscheid, 1981). In total, the human hand, including the wrist,has 21 degrees of freedom of movement.\nMuscles\nThere are 29 muscles that control movements of the hand, although some of these muscles are divided into distinct parts with separatetendons, such as the \ufb02exor digitorum profundus, which sends tendons to the distal phalanx of all four \ufb01ngers. If these subdivisions of\nmultitendoned muscles are counted separately, the number of muscles controlling the hand increases to 38 (Alexander, 1992). Most of the\nmuscles that control movements of the hand are in the forearm and are known as the extrinsic hand muscles (see \ufb01gure 2.5). These long \ufb02exor\nand extensor muscles of the wrist and \ufb01ngers take their origin from the bones in the arm, and as they approach the wrist the muscle bellies are\nreplaced by tendons (Kapandji, 1970). The \ufb02exor muscles arise from the medial epicondyle of the humerus in the upper arm or from the volar\nsurface of the radius and ulna, and they then travel down the inside of the forearm. At the wrist, the \ufb02exor tendons pass through the carpal\ntunnel bounded dorsally by the carpal bones and on the volar surface by the transverse carpal ligament. The main \ufb02exor muscles are the \ufb02exor\npollicis longus that \ufb02exes the distaljoint of the thumb, the \ufb02exor digitorum profundus that \ufb02exes the DIP joint of each \ufb01nger, and the \ufb02exor\ndigitorum super \ufb01cialis that \ufb02exes the PIP joint of each \ufb01nger. Flexion of the wrist involves the \ufb02exor carpi ulnaris, \ufb02exor carpi radialis, and\npalmaris longus. It is of interest to note that the palmaris longus muscle is absent in about 15% of the population (Taylor & Schwarz, 1970),\napparently without any functional consequences. It is sometimes used, however, as a donor of tendon graft material in correcting handdeformities (Taylor, Raj. Dick. & Solomon. 2004).\nThe extensor muscles take their origin from the ulna and course down the dorsal side of the forearm (see \ufb01gure 2.5). The dorsalcarpal\nligament guides the extensor tendons at the wrist, where they are arranged in six tendon compartments. The tendons of one of the extensors(extensor pollicis brevis) and abductors (abductor pollicis longus) of the thumb, which originate in the mid and distal parts of the radius, are inthe\ufb01rst dorsal compartment.

The epidermis is the outermost layer, which is responsible for the\nappearance and health of the skin. It also provides a protective barrier to prevent the loss of moisture and intrusion of bacteria and houses free(unencapsulated) nerve endings. The skin of the hand contains numerous eccrine sweat glands that keep the skin damp and assist in\ncontrolling body temperature through evaporative heat loss.\nWe show the structure of glabrous skin and the location of the mechanoreceptor endings in \ufb01gure 2.7, although we reserve discussion of the\nstructure and function of these mechanoreceptors untilchapter 3. On the gl abrous skin of the hand, the epidermis is composed of \ufb01ve\nsublayers: from outer to inner layer, these are the stratum corneum, the stratum lucidum (particularly evident in the thick palmar skin), the\nstratum granulosum, the stratum spinosum, and the stratum germinativum ( \ufb01gure 2.8).\nFigure 2.7.

They subsequently migrate toward the surface while progressively\ndehydrating and \ufb02attening in shape. With increasing age, this layer thins, making it more dif \ufb01cult to retain water. In young people, the newly\ngenerated cells take about 28 days (37 days for persons over the age of 50) to travel from the stratum germinativum to the stratum corneum.During cell migration, the cells \ufb01ll with a granular substance known as keratin. The outermost layer, known as the stratum corneum or\ncorneum layer, which varies in thickness from 0.2 to 2 mm, contains \ufb02attened, dry cells of soft keratin that are tightly bound together and\nsloughed off. Indeed, it has been suggested that about 80% of all house dust consists of these dead skin cells.\nThe second major layer of skin, the dermis, is shown in \ufb01gure 2.7. It consists of only two sublayers (not shown): the papillary (upper) and\nreticular (lower) layers (Thomine, 1981). The dermis is normally \ufb01ve to seven times thicker than the epidermis and makes up 15 \u201320% of the\ntotal body weight (Montagna, Kligman, & Carlisle, 1992).

The primary functions of the hypodermis are thermoregulation, protecting\nthe underlying tissues against mechanical trauma, and providing a source of energy (Montagna et al., 1992).\nThe hairy skin on the dorsal surface of the hand is histologically similar to palmar skin, in terms of the layered structure of the epidermis\n(Montagna et al., 1992). The epidermis is thinner on the dorsal as compared to the palmar surface and the stratum corneum is only 0.02 mm\nthick (Thomine, 1981). The dermis is also thinner and more mobile in dorsal skin, as it lacks the connective and elastic elements that anchorthe palmar skin to the underlying fascial planes. This allows the dorsal skin to stretch considerably with \ufb01nger movements, and so as the\nmiddle \ufb01nger moves from extension to full \ufb02exion, the skin can be lengthened by up to 30 mm. As discussed in chapter 3, it is this stretching\nof the dorsalskin during \ufb01nger movement that provides an important input to cutaneous mechanoreceptors.\nModels of the Hand\nBiomechanical models of the forces and moment arms of the tendons and muscles controlling the \ufb01ngers have been developed from anatomic\nand radiographic experiments on cadaverous specimens (Biryukova & Yourovskaya, 1994; Chao, An, Cooney, & Linscheid, 1989; Poznanski,\n1974) and from measurements of the externaldimensions of the hands (Garrett, 1971). Given the compl ex anatomicalstructure of the handwith 29 independent muscles, ligaments, and tendons and its anatomical and kinematic redundancy, a number of simplifying assumptions havebeen made in developing these models. Nevertheless, they have been used to estimate the centers of joint rotation, determine the muscle-tendon moment arms during angular rotation of the joint (Buford & Thompson, 1987), predict the posture of the hand as it grasps differentsizes of objects (Buchholz, Armstrong, & Goldstein, 1992), and assist in selecting muscles for tendon transfer surgery (Brand, 1985).\nThe mechanicalbehavior of the \ufb01ngers has also been studied in terms of their mechanical impedance, which speci \ufb01es the static and dynamic\nrelation between limb movement and an externally applied force. The focus of this research has been to understand what factors in \ufb02uence the\nmechanical impedance of the hand (e.g., joint angle, muscle activation level, velocity of joint movement) and how this in turn affects thestability and performance of the haptic interfaces that are used for teleoperation (Colgate & Brown, 1994). For the index \ufb01nger, the relation\nbetween force and displacement has been well characterized by a second-order linear model for both rapid (Hajian & Howe, 1997) and longer-term transients applied to the hand (Becker & Mote, 1990).

Measurements of the contact force and \ufb01ngertip displacement as individuals tap on a \ufb02at, rigid surface (Serina, Mote, & Rempel,\n1997) or grasp an object between the thumb and index \ufb01nger (Westling & Johansson, 1987) indicate that most of the displacement of the\n\ufb01ngertip pulp occurs at forces of less than 1 N. As can be seen in \ufb01gure 2.10, this relation is nonlinear. Due to the curvature of the \ufb01ngertip, as\nthe compression increases, there is a larger contact area, and so even at these low forces, the contact area increases rapidly with displacement as\nillustrated in \ufb01gure 2.10. On the index \ufb01nger, the contact area at 1 N is almost 70% of that at 5 N (Serina, Mockensturm, Mote, &Evolutionary Development and Anatomy of the Hand 21", "doc_id": "08471653-f74f-40b7-b304-6ff35d81cdde", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f389b94256609a930b060f37f58f85f84994c49de30b7d5ed2849bae855cc227", "extra_info": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2858, "end": 4858}, "relationships": {"1": "36a756d5-d9d5-45ed-90c7-4eab2b91e63f", "2": "8fc3950d-f5b9-4fca-9ca7-d86a627ed71d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3137ce53-92ab-4ae5-a6bd-d499907fc2e4": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 2.10.

The force-\ncontact area data are from Westling & Johansson, 1987, and come from a single participant, and the force-pulp displacement data are fromSerina et al., 1998, and are also from a single participant. Redrawn from Serina et al., 1998. with the permission of the authors and Elsevier.\nRempel, 1998; Westling & Johansson, 1987). At higher forces, the pulp stiffens rapidly from around 3.5 N mm\n-1at 1 N to over 20 N mm-1at 4\nN, which mechanically protects the distal phalanx from impact (Serina et al., 1997). These data suggest that it is the characteristics of the pulp\ntissues, and not the underlying hard tissues, that determine the force-displacement relation in the \ufb01ngertip. They also indicate why the \ufb01ngertip\nfunctions effectively as a tactile sensor at low forces (less than 1 N) in that small changes in force result in a considerable enhancement intactile mechanoreceptor activity, due to the increase in contact area. At higher forces, there is only a modest increase in contact area, and so\nlittle additional tactile information is gained (Serina et al., 1998). The effect of \ufb01ngertip force on tactile perception is discussed further in\nchapter 8.\nThe response of the \ufb01nger pulp to forces applied tangential to the skin surface has also been investigated. These tangential forces play an\nimportant role in the control of grasping, particularly when an object begins to slip between the \ufb01ngers (see chapter 6). Nakazawa, Ikeura, and\nInooka (2000) measured the deformation of the tip of the thumb and middle and little \ufb01ngers as forces were applied tangentially to the skin\nsurface, while the contact force was maintained constant at 1.9 N. Using a Kelvin model to represent the dynamics of the \ufb01ngertips in the\nshearing direction, they estimated the stiffness and viscosity as a function of shear force amplitude. At small shear forces of around 0.6 \u20131.2 N,\nthey found that the stiffness and viscosity were large in comparison to the values obtained at higher shear force amplitudes and that at shear\nforces greater than 1.7 N, they remained relatively constant. Nakazawa et al. (2000) also reported that the shear stiffness of the thumb was the\nlargest of the three digits tested, when the data were normalized for contact area. These \ufb01ndings suggest that when an object grasped in the\nhand is light, the shear deformation of the \ufb01ngertip is small and that changes in shear stiffness will occur with compression of the \ufb01ngertip.\nA number of models of the \ufb01ngertip pulp have been developed to predict the force-displacement and force-contact area responses of the\nhuman \ufb01ngertip during contact with rigid objects. Serina et al. (1998) modeled the \ufb01ngertip as an in \ufb02ated, ellipsoidal membrane that was\nassigned the properties of skin and \ufb01lled with an incompressible \ufb02uid.

In addition, the model's predictions of contact area closely matched those measured experimentally. However, the model is\nlimited in that the loading on the \ufb01ngertip must be quasi-static and applied at a \ufb01xed angle. At other angles, the contact area is not circular,\nwhich violates one of the model's assumptions. Srinivasan (1989) modeled the pulp as a two-dimensional, in \ufb01nite channel \ufb01lled with\nincompressible \ufb02uid that was covered with a \ufb02at, elastic membrane. This model predicted the surface deformation of the \ufb01ngerpad that\nmatched experimentaldata from the primate \ufb01nger to within 3 mm of the load, but it was limited to line loads. More recently, Dandekar, Raju,\nand Srinivasan (2003) have developed a multilayered, 3-D, \ufb01nite-element model of the \ufb01ngertip based on realistic external geometries, which is\nable to predict the behavior of mechanoreceptors in the skin. Nonlinear viscoelastic models of soft tissue (Fung, 1993) have also been used to\ndescribe the force-displacement response of the \ufb01ngertip pulp to a range of compression velocities (Pawluk & Howe, 1999). This viscoelastic\nmodel, which incorporates a force-relaxation function, was able to predict \ufb01ngertip force from pulp compression during rapid \ufb01nger tapping,\nsuch as occurs when typing (Jindrich, Zhou, Becker, & Dennerlein, 2003). Fung's model's parameters were similar to those estimated byPawluk and Howe (1999), despite the much greater dynamic loading conditions in the \ufb01nger-tapping experiments.\nThese models of the dynamic response of the human \ufb01ngerpad to loads have generally been evaluated within fairly restricted experimental\nconditions. Due to the complexity of the skin and underlying tissues, which are nonlinear, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic, many assumptions\nhave been made in developing these models. Nevertheless, from a biomechanical point of view , they have achieved some success in identifying\nthe critical elements involved in prehension and in maintaining a stable grasp. This research would clearly bene \ufb01t from better in vivo models of\nthe glabrous skin of the hand.\nThe evolution of the hand and its present anatomical con \ufb01guration provide a framework for understanding the versatility and limitations of\nthe human hand. Clearly, the development of an opposable thumb resulted in a dramatic increase in the types of tasks that the hand could nowundertake, from exploring small items within the hand to grasping objects between the \ufb01ngers and thumb. These functions are described in\nmore detail in chapter 8. However, it is not only the structural elements of the hand that have contributed to its versatility, but also the soft\ntissues within the hand and the properties of the glabrous and hairy skin that covers the palmar and dorsal surfaces, respectively . The sensorymechanoreceptors within the skin are uniquely positioned to provide the central nervous system with information about \ufb01nger movements\nand the materialand geometric properties of objects hel d within the hand.

This includes mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors in the skin,\nproprioceptive inputs from muscles and joints, and centrally originating signals known as corollary discharges. Peripheral motorneurophysiology is not covered in this chapter, as the general principles of motor unit organization and muscle activation are similar in skeletalmuscles throughout the body (see McComas, 1996; Vrbova, 1995). We subsequently describe the primary sensory pathways that project to the\ncortex and the principal cortical areas that are involved in processing sensory and motor information involving the hand. We close the chapter\nby discussing the nature of corticalsensory and motor representation and pl asticity.\nMechanoreceptors: Glabrous Skin\nAreas of Controversy\nBefore describing the different mechanoreceptor-afferent populations and their presumed functions, it is important to highlight several critica l\nareas of discussion or controversy. First, a good deal of what is known about hand function originally derived from two separate but related\nscienti \ufb01c disciplines, namely, psychophysics and single-unit neurophysiology. It was Mountcastle (1967) who provided the critical impetus to\ncombine these two experimental perspectives simultaneously within a single organism because they served the same purpose: to understandsensory performance and its underlying neural mechanisms. At that time, however, it was not possible to perform both techniques within thesame subject. Hence, monkeys were used in the neurophysiological studies and humans in the corresponding psychophysical research. It wasassumed that \u201cwhat monkeys and humans feel with their hands is in principle the same, and that neurophysiological observations made in the\none may with some validity be correlated with psychophysical measures in the other, given the precise experimental design in the two cases \u201d\n(Talbot, Darian-Smith, Kornhuber, & Mountcastle, 1968, p. 301).\nIt is important to highlight the fact that while the structure and function of their nervous systems are highly similar, there are also differences\nthat may", "doc_id": "32bd68a6-9e55-4668-ab2a-efcd19adc746", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1913f2aa6717b4ecd426739720bab4d3b7af4a133833ebd5d94abbc3e080f6b5", "extra_info": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2805}, "relationships": {"1": "3819e798-9fb7-4635-a2b1-cbe53e708c0e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f420f815-0b2a-4818-ac3c-685c214398b6": {"__data__": {"text": "alter perceptual function in humans and monkeys in meaningfully different ways. In the next section, we will discuss in detail the four\nmechanoreceptor populations that are present in the glabrous skin of humans. For now , we merely note that while one of these\nmechanoreceptor populations, slowly adapting type II (SA II), has been reliably identi \ufb01ed in the human hand using microneurography (Vallbo\n& Johansson, 1978), it has never been observed in neurophysiological studies with monkeys (Johnson, 2001). Another difference betweenhuman and monkey hands relates to the location of the Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors. These are concentrated near nerves and bloodvessels in the metacarpophalangeal (MP) region of the human cadaver hand (Stark, Carlstedt, Hallin, & Risling, 1998), as opposed to thethenar and hypothenar areas in monkey hands (Kumamoto, Senuma, Ebara, & Matsuura, 1993). The functionalconsequences, if any, ofdifferences such as these have rarely been investigated.\nSecond, for well over a century now , investigators have argued over the relationship between various cutaneous afferent \ufb01bers and their\nreceptor endings. A number of different methods have been used to address this issue, including histology, single-unit recordings,immuno \ufb02uorescence labeling, and even to some extent simple logic. Given incomplete evidence pertaining to afferent \ufb01ber-receptor\nassociations in human skin, investigators have assumed the existence of several associations based on the available histological andneurophysiological evidence in animals and humans. Conclusive evidence has only been obtained for the association between the considerablylarger Pacinian corpuscles and fast adapting type II (FA II) afferents.\nThird, over the past severaldecades, researchers in the \ufb01elds of neurophysiology and psychophysics have become interested in determining\nthe nature of the codes that the nervous system uses to represent human somatosensory sensations and percepts. Untilabout the middl e of\nthe 20th century, the two disciplines worked separately but in parallel on complementary facets of this problem. Whereas neurophysiological\nstudies focused on the relation between the physical stimulus (physical events) and the responses of single afferent units (neural events),psychophysical studies focused on the nature of the psychophysical law, that is, the mathematical function describing the relation between thephysical stimulus (physical events) and human tactual sensory experiences (mental events). More recently , investigators have tried to relatethese two branches in their attempt to understand how the somatosensory system represents human perceptualexperience. However,problems do arise because in many cases the neurophysiological research has been based on animal models and often on the responses ofanesthetized animals (e.g., monkey, cat, raccoon, mouse), whereas the psychophysical work has been based on the responses of alert humans.One interesting attempt to bridge the gap was developed in Sweden in the late 1960s, when investigators combined two techniques,\nmicroneurography (recording from a single afferent unit) and microstimulation (stimulation of the same afferent), within an attentive human\nobserver (e.g., Knibest\u00f6l & Vallbo, 1970; Mace \ufb01eld, Gandevia, & Burke, 1990; Vallbo, 1995).\nThe manner in which the somatosensory system represents sensory experiences is a matter of some controversy. One approach advocates a\nfeature-detector model, in which a speci \ufb01c population of tactile units is responsible for encoding a speci \ufb01c feature, such as roughness, softness,\ncurvature, orientation, slip, skin stretch, or vibration (see Connor & Johnson, 1992; Dodson, Goodwin, Browning, & Gehring, 1998;Goodwin & Wheat, 1992; Johansson & Westling, 1987; LaMotte &", "doc_id": "f420f815-0b2a-4818-ac3c-685c214398b6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c2929ec20352be2005b5f88cba3e57cdeeca51106e2ac95fbca761395d6d7a3e", "extra_info": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3795}, "relationships": {"1": "ca177700-0e69-408a-8cbb-deeff21d090e", "3": "4bcf2aee-3776-41fc-869e-2e2c9663cbd0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bcf2aee-3776-41fc-869e-2e2c9663cbd0": {"__data__": {"text": "same afferent), within an attentive human\nobserver (e.g., Knibest\u00f6l & Vallbo, 1970; Mace \ufb01eld, Gandevia, & Burke, 1990; Vallbo, 1995).\nThe manner in which the somatosensory system represents sensory experiences is a matter of some controversy.

An alternate class of modelhas argued for a multichannel approach to human sensation in which multiple information-processing channels with overlapping sensitivities,each one mediated by its own neural mechanism, simultaneously encode the physical stimulus continuum (e.g., the multichannel model of\nvibratory sensation proposed by Bolanowski, Gescheider, Verrillo, & Checkosky, 1988). We will discuss some aspects of these approaches in\ngreater detail.\nTypes of Mechanoreceptors\nTactile sensing activates a variety of tactile units, each consisting of an afferent \ufb01ber and its (presumed) ending. There are four different types\nof endings in the glabrous skin of the human hand: Merkel cells, Meissner's corpuscles, Ruf \ufb01ni endings, and Pacinian corpuscles. Merkel cells\nare located in clusters within the basal layer at the tip of the deep epidermal folds that project into the dermis.

They are located\ndeep within both the dermis and the subcutaneous fat layer that lies below the dermis. The four types of endings can be seen in \ufb01gure 3.1.\nFour separate populations of tactile afferents have been documented in the glabrous skin of the human hand (e.g., Knibest\u00f6l & Vallbo, 1970;\nfor valuable summaries, see Johansson & Vallbo, 1983; Johnson, 2001; Vallbo & Johansson, 1984). These are known as SA I (slowly adapting\ntype I; described as SA in the monkey), FA I (fast adapting type I; in the monkey described as RA, or rapidly adapting, and in the olderliterature, as QA, or quick adapting), FA II (fast adapting type II; also known as PC or Pacinian in the monkey), and SA II (slowly adaptingtype II; never reported in the monkey) afferents. In this book, we adopt the ancient nomenclature used by the author(s) of each study under\ndiscussion. Although all populations respond to mechanical stimulation, they may be differentiated using several criteria. First, each type of\nafferent \ufb01ber is (presumed to be) associated with a speci \ufb01c type of ending. In human glabrous skin, SA I afferents end in Merkel cell neurite\ncomplexes, SA II afferents in Ruf \ufb01ni endings, FA I afferents in Meissner's corpuscles, and FA II units in Pacinian corpuscles.\nMicroneurography has been used to differentiate and identify the physiological responses of the four types of human cutaneous afferents (e.g.,\nKnibest\u00f6l & Vallbo, 1970). In this procedure, the nerve is \ufb01rst located by palpation or low-intensity electrical stimulation. A recording\nmicroelectrode (an insulated tungsten needle) is then manually inserted into the skin, usually with a pair of isolated forceps. The microelectrodepenetrates the underlying tissue until a nerve fascicle (skin or muscle) is found and impaled. The electrode is then moved in very smallincrements untilthe appropriate activity from a singl e unit in the nerve is recorded, which may take from a few minutes to an hour (Prochazka\n& Hulliger, 1983). The receptive \ufb01eld of the speci \ufb01c tactile unit that has been engaged by the electrode is initially mapped out by exploring the\nskin of the hand with a probe. The relative physiological response of the single afferent unit to sustained stimulation is then determined. Thesetwo parameters, relative receptive- \ufb01eld size and relative response to sustained stimulation, are the criteria used to identify the type of unit, as\nshown in \ufb01gure 3.2.\nFigures 3.3 and 3.4 should also be consulted in conjunction with the following description of the four mechanoreceptor populations.

This implies that human tactile pattern recognition is\nindependent of contact forces ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 N (Johnson, Yoshioka, & Vega-Bermudez, 2000). SA I spatial resolution is minimally\nin\ufb02uenced by the scanning velocity up to at least 80 mm/second (Vega-Bermudez, Johnson, & Hsiao. 1991). The response of SA I units to\nrepeated skin indentation is invariant; that is to say, the variability is around 1 impulse/trial, independent of the number of action potentialselicited (Vega-Bermudez & Johnson, 1999). Given these response characteristics, humans can discriminate form and texture very well. As SA Iunits constitute the only population that responds linearly to skin indentations up to about 1500 \u03bcm (Blake, Johnson, & Hsiao, 1997), they also\ncode curvature very well (Bisley, Goodwin, & Wheat, 2000). Humans are able to differentiate curvature without regard to contact force(normal) (Goodwin, John, & Marceglia, 1991) or contact area (Goodwin & Wheat, 1992), which suggests that like other forms of spatialpattern, curvature is neurally represented by a spatially distributed, as opposed to an intensive, code.

When these responses, which were originally reported in terms of number of impulses/cycle, are replotted in terms of the intensity\ncharacteristics of the mechanoreceptor, the low-frequency range of sensitivity of the physiological data resembles the human psychophysical\ndata (Bolanowski et al., 1988). SA I units in the human \ufb01ngertip respond to the application of normal force (e.g., Westling & Johansson, 1984).\nIn addition, when a force is applied to a site on the human \ufb01ngertip at a 20 \u00b0angle from the normal, all afferents that are reliably activated (i.e.,\nSA I, SA II, and FA I, but not FA II units) respond; however, in most units the responses are broadly tuned to a speci \ufb01c direction. With\nrespect to the SA I population, response sensitivity is greatest to tangential force components applied in the distal direction (Birznieks,Jenmalm, Goodwin, & Johansson, 2001; Goodwin & Wheat, 2004). SA units in the primate \ufb01ngerpad also show sustained responses to lateral\nstretch (Srinivasan, Whitehouse, & LaMotte, 1990).\nThe FA I units are presumed to terminate in Meissner's corpuscles ( \ufb01gure 3.1). They are even more densely distributed than the SA I units,\nabout 1.5 units per mm\n2in the \ufb01ngertip ( \ufb01gure 3.3). Like the SA I units, their receptive \ufb01elds are relatively small, about 3 \u20135 mm in diameter\n(\ufb01gure 3.4). However, because they respond evenly across their entire receptive \ufb01eld, they are poorer at discriminating very \ufb01ne spatialdetail s.\nAlthough they are insensitive to static contact, they respond well to transient deformation and particularly to the low-frequency vibration(Johnson et al., 2000) that occurs during initial contact and periods of relative motion between skin and object. FA I units respond to theapplication of normal force (e.g., Westling & Johansson, 1984) and are most sensitive to tangential force components in the proximal andradial directions (Birznieks et al., 2001). In addition, FA I units provide critical feedback for precise grip control (Johansson & Westling, 1984),in that they detect both actual slip between skin and object and local micro-slips. FA I units also signal forces that act suddenly on an objectgrasped in the hand (Mace \ufb01eld, H\u00e4ger-Ross, & Johansson, 1996). Based on psychophysical data, it has been suggested that FA I units are\nmaximally sensitive to vibrotactile temporal frequencies ranging from about 3 to 40 Hz, which produce the sensation of \u201c\ufb02utter\u201d(Talbot et al.,\n1968). As noted above, the shape of the psychophysical curve for threshold amplitude as a function of sinusoidal frequency is similar to thatobtained for FA I unit responses to sinusoidalstimul ation (0.5 \u2013400 Hz) by Johansson et al.

For a detailed discussion of the cause of the\ndiscrepancy, the reader should consult Bolanowski et al. (1988).\nEach FA II unit ends in a single Pacinian corpuscle ( \ufb01gure 3.1). These units are less densely distributed in the hand than are either SA I or FA I\nunits (about 350 per \ufb01nger and 800 in the palm; \ufb01gure 3.3). They also have extremely large receptive \ufb01elds, which render the FA II units poor\nat discriminating spatialdetail s ( \ufb01gure 3.4). However they are exquisitely sensitive to transient stimulation, including vibration. For example,\nTalbot et al. (1968) showed that the thresholds of some FA II units for sinusoidal stimulation were as low as \u02dc1\u03bcm at 200 \u2013300 Hz. Sensitivity\ndropped steeply below about 150 Hz, presumably the result of the low-frequency temporal \ufb01ltering properties of the Pacinian corpuscle with\nits multilayer structure. FA II units are also very important for detecting more remote events, for example, those that occur with hand-heldobjects (Johnson, 2001). Based on psychophysical data, it has been suggested that FA II units are maximally sensitive to vibrotactile temporalfrequencies ranging from 40 to >500 Hz, with a maximum sensitivity around 300 Hz, and that they produce the sensation of \u201cvibration \u201d\nwithin that frequency range (Bolanowski et al., 1988). One notable difference between the psychophysical function and the FA II\nneurophysiological function directly obtained by Johansson et al. (1982) is that the decrease in sensitivity over the lower frequency range is\nsteeper for the former than for the latter.Neurophysiology of Hand Function 29", "doc_id": "5232153b-bb55-4010-8e4c-0a1dbbd4ef5e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c03f7fffe9a59a76e0167d163811408a2cdc8d380093ebe0e12452a254a4650d", "extra_info": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3024}, "relationships": {"1": "14381f1d-e68e-482b-9fc0-52f518f9cf03"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "02816c3f-0e93-4026-ad7e-80a7da02fdd8": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 3.5.

Par\u00e9, Smith, and Rice (2002) have suggested that \u201cclumped \u201dMerkelendings are the terminal s of the SA I\nunits, and further that the elongated \u201cchain\u201dMerkelendings may in fact be the source of the SA II afferent responses. The receptive \ufb01elds of\nSA II units are about \ufb01ve times larger and their sensitivity to skin deformation about six times poorer than those of the SA I units ( \ufb01gure 3.4).\nHence, they are not usefulin detecting \ufb01ne spatial details. Based on human psychophysical data and by a process of elimination, Bolanowski et\nal. (1988) have suggested that SA II units are most sensitive to vibrotactile frequencies ranging from 100 to >500 Hz and produce thesensation of \u201cbuzzing \u201d(personal observation; Bolanowski, Gescheider, & Verrillo, 1994). SA II units are two to four times more sensitive than\nSA I units to skin stretch (particularly in the proximal direction), as described later in this chapter (Birznieks et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2000).\nThey contribute to the perception of the direction of object motion and force when an object produces skin stretch (Olausson, Wessberg, &\nKakuda, 2000). Together with muscle spindles (and perhaps joint afferent units), SA II units also play an especially important role in perceivinghand con \ufb01guration and \ufb01nger position (Edin & Johansson, 1995).\nMechanoreceptors: Hairy Skin\nThere are \ufb01ve main types of mechanoreceptors with large myelinated afferents that have been identi \ufb01ed in hairy skin, two of which are slowly\nadapting, namely, Merkel cells and Ruf \ufb01ni endings, and three that are rapidly adapting. The latter include non-encapsulated hair-follicle\nreceptors that innervate hairs, \ufb01eld units whose histological structure remains unclear, and Pacinian corpuscles (Vallbo, Olausson, Wessberg, &\nKakuda, 1995). These mechanoreceptors and their associated afferent \ufb01bers have properties similar to the tactile units described in glabrous\nskin (Greenspan & Bolanowski, 1996; J\u00e4rvilehto, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, & Soininen, 1981). In hairy skin, the SA I receptors are Merkel cells that are\nfound within the epidermis and are grouped under visible touch domes with each cell receiving a single afferent that innervates many\nreceptors. The Ruf \ufb01ni endings (SA II receptors) are usually found around hair follicles in the dermis. Hairfollicle receptors are usually\nidenti\ufb01ed by their brisk response to movements of individualhairs and l ight air puffs, whereas \ufb01eld units are not sensitive to hair movements\nand are classi \ufb01ed on the basis of their rapidly adapting responses and the multiple spots with high sensitivity found within their receptive \ufb01elds\n(Vallbo et al., 1995). In contrast to glabrous skin, Pacinian corpuscles are rare in hairy skin and when found are usually in the vicinity of joints,tendon sheaths, and interosseous membranes (Gandevia, 1996; Zimny, DePaolo, & Dabezies, 1989). There are also unmyelinated (conductionvelocities of about 1 m/s) tactile units in hairy skin, some of which have low thresholds to mechanical stimuli.

The relative number of SA units is higher in the hairy skin on the back of the hand than in the glabrous skin on the palm(J\u00e4rvilehto et al., 1981), and the distinction between SA I and SA II units is not as clear as in glabrous skin (Edin & Abbs, 1991). In addition,the properties of some SA units in hairy skin differ from those in glabrous skin (J\u00e4rvilehto et al., 1981). One difference between SA I units inhairy and glabrous skin is that in hairy skin they are responsive to levels of stimulation that are below human perceptual thresholds\n(Harrington & Merzenich, 1970), and they can discharge continuously without eliciting any perceptual response (J\u00e4rvilehto, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, &\nLaurinen, 1976). However, the force thresholds for activating tactile units in hairy skin are similar to those reported for glabrous skin, with SAII units having the highest thresholds (5 mN) and the \ufb01eld units the lowest (0.1 mN) (Edin & Abbs, 1991).\nBolanowski et al. (1994) have suggested that tactile sensations resulting from mechanical (i.e., vibratory) stimulation of hairy skin are\ndetermined by activity in three psychophysically de \ufb01ned channels, each neurally controlled by a separate mechanoreceptor population.

The NPh low is mediated by SA II \ufb01bers that innervate Ruf \ufb01ni endings and is the neuralsubstrate for l ow-frequency\nresponses (0.4 \u20134 Hz). The NPh mid channel, which is probably mediated by rapidly adapting hair-follicle receptors, responds to stimulation\nfrequencies in the midrange (4 \u201345 Hz or 4 \u2013150 Hz), depending on contactor area. Finally, the P channel mediates responses to high-frequency\nvibrotactile stimulation ranging from about 45 to more than 500 Hz. The responses in this channel are probably mediated by Paciniancorpuscles located in the subcutaneous tissue. The above results suggest that the capacity of hairy skin to signal mechanical events differs from\nglabrous skin, which probably uses four channels, with one channel (P) being considerably more sensitive than any of the channels seen in\nhairy skin. The threshold functions for vibratory stimuli measured on the hairy skin of the forearm are an order of magnitude higher thanthose recorded on the palm of the hand (Merzenich & Harrington, 1969). This is not only due to variations in the innervation density of thetwo types of skin, but also re \ufb02ects differences in the response properties of the mechanoreceptors and possibly in the mechanical coupling of\nthe skin and stimulator.\nMechanoreceptors in hairy skin respond to mechanicaldeformation of the skin and al so discharge in response to \ufb01nger movements, which\ntypically stretch the loosely connected skin on the dorsum of the hand. The majority of these receptors respond to movements of more than\none joint, as shown in \ufb01gure 3.6, with the pattern of skin stretch during \ufb01nger movements determining which units respond. SA II units are\nparticularly responsive to different types of movements around a joint (Edin & Abbs, 1991). Their responses to joint movements are similar to\nthose of muscle spindle afferents with \ufb01ring rates up to 50 impulses/second, which is considerably lower than their discharge rates for tactile\ninputs, which can be greater than 200 impulses/second (Grill & Hallett, 1995).\nFigure 3.6.

For example, 20 units responded only to movement of the MP joint of the index \ufb01nger, whereas 8 units responded to\nmovements of both the MP and PIP joints; a further 10 units responded to movements of the MP joints of both the index and middle \ufb01ngers;\nand 3 units responded to movements of the MP joint of the index \ufb01nger and of the thumb. Reprinted from Edin & Abbs, 1991, with the\npermission of the American Physiological Society.\nThe proprioceptive information that SA II mechanoreceptors provide the CNS is ambiguous with respect to movement direction and\namplitude.

Smith, personal communication, June 2005) that neurophysiologists\nmay have oversimpli \ufb01ed receptor innervation and function in cases where a one-receptor/one- \ufb01ber association has been assumed.\nElectrophysiological studies have tended to ignore the multiple large- and small- \ufb01ber innervations of Meissner corpuscles and hair follicles.\nThermoreceptors\nDuring active haptic exploration and object manipulation, information concerning hand movements and the objects contacted is derived from\nmechanoreceptors in skin and muscle. Thermal information about objects comes from thermoreceptive afferent units in the skin. There aretwo kinds of thermoreceptors, known as cold and warm receptors, both of which are free nerve endings located in the epidermal and dermal\nskin layers (Spray, 1986). Cold receptors are more numerous than warm receptors, respond to decreases in temperature over a range of\n5\u201343\u00b0C, and discharge most vigorously at skin temperatures of 25 \u00b0C. In contrast, warm receptors discharge with increasing skin temperature\nand reach a maximum around 45 \u00b0C (Stevens, 1991). When the skin is maintained at a temperature of 30 \u201336\u00b0C, no thermalsensation is noted,\nalthough both types of receptor exhibit spontaneous \ufb01ring. During the course of daily activities, the skin temperature of the hand can span a\nrange of 20 \u201340\u00b0C, but typically remains between 30 and 35 \u00b0C. The relative distribution of thermoreceptors in glabrous and hairy skin has not\nbeen studied, and so it is not known to what extent differences in thermalsensitivity in different regions of the hand re \ufb02ect variations in\ninnervation.\nThere is a fairly abrupt change in the character of thermal sensation to one of pain if the temperature rises above 45 \u00b0C or falls below 13 \u00b0C\n(Darian-Smith & Johnson, 1977; Havenith, van de Linde, & Heus, 1992; Johnson, Darian-Smith, & LaMotte, 1973). At these extreme\ntemperatures, thermalinformation is conveyed by thermalnociceptors, which signaltissue damage. The onset of col d pain, which is associated\nwith skin temperatures below 14 \u00b0C is slow , as damage from freezing usually takes time. This is very different from the rapid withdrawal of the\naffected body part when the skin temperature rises to 45 \u00b0C, and damage is imminent.\nIt has been estimated that the innervation density of cold and probably warm \ufb01bers in the area of glabrous skin innervated by the median\nnerve in the hand is approximately 50 \u201370\ufb01bers/cm\n2(Darian-Smith, 1984; Johnson et al., 1973). Afferent \ufb01bers innervating warm receptors\nhave conduction velocities in the range of 1 \u20132 m/s, which identi \ufb01es them as unmyelinated \ufb01bers.

They are located in muscle spindles, which areelongated structures ranging from 4 to 10 mm in length, that are composed of bundles (up to 14) of small intrafusal \ufb01bers (Swash & Fox,\n1972). The spindles lie in parallel to the extrafusal muscle \ufb01bers, the force-generating component of muscle, and attach at both ends either to\nextrafusal \ufb01bers or to muscle tendons.

Some spindles are also innervated by skeletofusimotor, or beta, \ufb01bers that project to both\nextrafusaland intrafusalmuscl e \ufb01bers (Hulliger, 1984).\nThe number of spindles in human muscles varies depending on the function of the muscle, and for the hand has been estimated to range from\n12 for the abductor digiti minimi, one of the hypothenar muscles, to 356 for the \ufb02exor digitorum super \ufb01cialis (Voss, 1971). When expressed in\nterms of the number of spindles per gram of mean weight of adult muscle, higher spindle densities are generally found in muscles involved in\ufb01ne movements, such as the distal \ufb01nger muscles, and in the maintenance of posture. In contrast to the tactile sensory system, in which higher\ndensities of mechanoreceptors are clearly associated with superior tactile acuity, for the proprioceptive system, higher spindle densities do notappear to be associated with superior sensory acuity. There is no evidence indicating a superior acuity for detecting movements and changes inlimb position as one goes from proximal to distal joints. When expressed in terms of the absolute angular rotation of the joint, the ability to\ndetect movements is in fact better for more proximaljoints, such as the el bow and shoul der, than for the distaljoints of the hand, as\nGoldscheider \ufb01rst noted in 1889. This superior performance of more proximal joints is not surprising because they move more slowly than\ndistal joints, and rotation of these joints results in a larger displacement of the end-point of the limb (the \ufb01ngertip in the case of the arm) than\nthe same angular rotation at a more distal joint. If the extent of movement is expressed in terms of changes in muscle fascicle length duringjoint rotation, then proximal and distal joints actually give comparable proprioceptive performance, and the distal to proximal gradient insensitivity disappears (Hall & McCloskey, 1983).\nMuscle spindle receptors are speci \ufb01cally responsive to changes in muscle length because of their location in muscles.

Primary afferents are, however, highly nonlinear, and their discharge rates depend on several factors,\nincluding the recent contractile history of the muscle, the length of the muscle, the velocity with which the muscle changes length, and the\nactivity of the fusimotor system. Secondary afferents demonstrate much less dynamic responsiveness and have a more regular discharge ratethan do primary afferents at a constant muscle length (Prochazka, 1996). They also display much greater (around 50%) position sensitivitythan do primary muscle spindle afferents (Edin & Vallbo, 1990). The higher dynamic sensitivity of the primary spindle receptors is consistent\nwith the idea that they signal the velocity and direction of muscle stretch or limb movement, whereas the secondary spindle receptors providethe central nervous system with information about static muscle length or limb position. Figure 3.8 provides a schematic summary of thedischarge rates of primary and secondary spindle afferent \ufb01bers during changes in muscle length, with and without fusimotor stimulation. As\ncan be seen, the discharge rates of these receptors are not simply a function of changes in muscle length but also re \ufb02ect the activity of the\nfusimotor system. In order to decode these afferent signals, the central nervous system must have access to information regarding the level offusimotor activity so that it can distinguish between changes in discharge rates that are proprioceptively signi \ufb01cant from those that are the\nresult of fusimotor activity. It has been proposed that this is accomplished with corollaries of the motor command, which are transmitted to\nthe sensory centers in the brain (McCloskey, 1981).\nThe third class of mechanoreceptor found in muscle is the Golgi tendon organ, an encapsulated receptor about 0.2 \u20131 mm long and 0.1 mm in\ndiameter, normally found at the junction between muscle tendon and a small group of extrafusal muscle \ufb01bers. This receptor is therefore \u201cin\nseries\u201dwith a small number (usually 10 \u201320 in human muscles) of extrafusal muscle \ufb01bers. It is selectively responsive to the forces these \ufb01bers\ndevelop and has little or no response to the contraction of other muscle \ufb01bers (Jami, 1992). Because tendon organs are very sensitive to the\ninseries forces, most tendon organs in a muscle discharge in all but the smallest contraction. A single Group Ib axon innervates each tendonorgan. In primate muscles, Golgi tendon organs are less numerous and more variable in number than spindle receptors, and some muscles,such as the lumbrical muscles of the hand, do not appear to have any tendon organ receptors (Devanandan, Ghosh, & John, 1983).\nThe distribution of tendon organs in a muscle is generally wide enough that every motor unit is included in the activity of the receptors at least\nonce.\nFigure 3.8.

The relation between the activity of a single motor unit and an isolated tendon organ afferent in human\nmuscles is usually nonlinear, and may even be discontinuous, with steps in the frequency of discharge re \ufb02ecting the contraction of individual\nmotor units (Vallbo, 1974).\nMicroneurographic recordings have provided valuable information about the activity of muscle receptors during voluntary movements and\nhave had an important impact on hypotheses regarding muscle spindle function. Recordings from human subjects have shown that theposition sensitivity of spindle receptors in \ufb01nger\ufb02exor muscles is remarkably low (less than 1 impulse/mm muscle length) and that both\nprimary and secondary afferents have a low resting discharge and are silent at the muscle length that corresponds to the comfortable resting\nposition of the human hand (Vallbo, 1974). It has also been shown that the discharge rates of primary and secondary afferents from the \ufb01nger\nextensor muscles do not differ signi \ufb01cantly when the joint is actively maintained at different positions, as can be seen in \ufb01gure 3.9. The absence\nof any position response in the discharge rates of muscle afferents suggests that changes in fusimotor activity compensate for variations inmuscle length (Hulliger, Nordh, & Vallbo, 1982).\nThere are limitations to the use of microneurography in muscle nerve fascicles, particularly with respect to the range of movement speeds,\namplitudes, and forces that can be studied. Generally, the movements and forces generated are restricted to the lower end of the physiologicalrange in order to prevent the microelectrode from dislodging and to limit interference from other active units. The low background \ufb01ring rates\nof human muscle spindle afferents (<20 impulses s\n-1) and the small changes in discharge rates attributed to fusimotor action (<30 impulses s-1)\nas compared to recordings made in alert cats have been ascribed to the restricted experimental conditions used in human studies and the\nheightened level of alertness of animals in the laboratory environment (Prochazka & Hulliger, 1998).\nIn summary, muscle spindle receptors and Golgi tendon organs convey information about the length of muscles, the rates at which muscle\nlengths are changing, and the forces generated by muscles. This information provides the basis for the perception of the amplitude andvelocity of \ufb01nger movements and the static position of the hand. It also enables us to estimate the weight and compliance of objects supported\nby the hand. Information about changes in limb position and movement arises from other sensory sources, such as receptors in the skin andjoints. Cutaneous afferents from the hand can re \ufb02exively affect fusimotor neurons innervating forearm extensor muscles and so make an\nindirect, as well as direct, contribution to proprioception (Gandevia, Wilson, Cordo, & Burke, 1994).

Paciniform endings are probably rapidly adapting, like their counterparts in skin,\nwhereas Ruf \ufb01ni and Golgi endings are probably slowly adapting (Zimny, 1988). The distribution of these receptors is nonuniform in a joint,\nwhich may re \ufb02ect the location of stresses during limb movements (Gandevia, 1996). Most articular receptors discharge near the extremes of\njoint movement and often are active during both extreme \ufb02exion and extension and so do not provide an unambiguous signalrel ated to joint\nposition (Proske, Schaible, & Schmidt, 1988). Other joint afferents discharge during the midrange of joint movement, and estimates of thepercentages of this class of receptor range from 5% to 18% in various animal species (Ferrell, 1980).\nThese midrange joint receptors do respond to \ufb01nger movements throughout the physiological range of joint rotation and so provide the\ncentralnervous system with some kinematic information (Edin, 1990). However, their capacity to signalthe direction of joint movement is\nlimited, and so it has been proposed that joint afferent input may only be signi \ufb01cant when muscle spindle afferents cannot contribute to\nproprioception (Burke, Gandevia, & Mace \ufb01eld, 1988). Studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have undergone prosthetic\nreplacement of the metacarpophalangeal joints in the hand suggest that whatever information is conveyed by joint receptors is adequatelyduplicated by other sensory sources. These patients have normal position sense in the absence of joint receptors (Cross & McCloskey, 1973)and are able to reproduce accurately the amplitude of movements made by \ufb01ngers with prosthetic joints (Kelso, Holt, & Flatt, 1980).\nAn anatomicalpecul iarity of the hand has provided a preparation that has been used in numerous experiments to study the contribution of\njoint and cutaneous receptors to proprioception. When the \ufb01ngers surrounding the middle \ufb01nger are all maximally extended and the middle\n\ufb01nger is \ufb02exed, the distalinterphal angealjoint of the middl e \ufb01nger can no longer be voluntarily controlled as its tendon is slack because the\nmuscles are decoupled from the joint (Gandevia & McCloskey, 1976). When the \ufb01nger is positioned this way, only joint and cutaneous\nfeedback can contribute to proprioception. The ability to detect the direction of applied \ufb02exion and extension movements within the midrange\nof joint position is impaired with the muscles disengaged, and the residual ability to detect these movements does depend on joint afferentfeedback. Clark, Grigg, and Chapin (1989) found that a local anesthetic block of the \ufb01nger joint resulted in a further impairment in the ability\nto detect movements imposed on the joint. This indicates that when movement signals from muscle receptors are absent, articular receptorscan provide cues that signaljoint movement.\nCorollary Discharges\nThe centralnervous system appears to monitor its own activity in producing muscl e contractions, and these correl ates or copies of the motorcommand have been referred to historically as sensations of innervation (Helmholtz, 1866/1925) and more recently as corollary discharges or\nefference copies (McCloskey, 1981).

Thedischarge rates of muscle spindle receptors are not only a function of changes in the length of the muscle but also re \ufb02ect the activity of the\nfusimotor system. The centralnervous system therefore needs to distinguish the spindl e responses that are a consequence of fusimotor activity\nfrom those that are a result of an external perturbation and that have proprioceptive signi \ufb01cance.\nSensory Cortical Projections\nSensory information from receptors in the hand and from muscles controlling \ufb01nger movements isNeurophysiology of Hand Function 37", "doc_id": "a24a04b5-0859-431c-9908-7b34cf1e6a8b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "def0d0e82babe93cbdbc6d079fef4fec546703cc0953c9c1b0e0c77b47ecf1a4", "extra_info": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2787, "end": 4694}, "relationships": {"1": "e9a31dd9-47ee-44f6-9d11-f0e152f4f13d", "2": "3a94277f-5caa-48aa-b94f-27af58050764"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "645a6255-28b5-4e6f-9f3d-80426b9ccb25": {"__data__": {"text": "conveyed via afferent nerve \ufb01bers to the dorsalroot gangl ion neurons which l ie on the dorsalroot of a spinalnerve.

The nerve terminal s of dorsalroot\nganglion neurons determine the function of the neuron. The area of skin innervated by a single dorsal root is known as a dermatome, whichcan be identi \ufb01ed in animals by stimulating the skin with different probes and measuring the response from afferent \ufb01bers in the dorsalroot.\nDermatomalmaps are often used as a diagnostic aid for l ocating the site of injury in humans with damage to the spinalcord or dorsalroots.\nThe large-diameter axons mediating touch and proprioception diverge from the smaller-diameter afferents subserving temperature and pain in\nthe spinal cord, and they follow different pathways to the brain. Figure 3.10 depicts these two ascending pathways on a series of brain slices.The small-diameter \ufb01bers terminate on second-order neurons in the dorsalhorn of the spinalcord, and the axons of these neurons cross the\nmidline to form the anterolateral system (Gardner, Martin, & Jessell, 2000). The axons serving these two modalities are segregated and are\narranged somatotopically as they ascend the spinal cord. The anterolateral system has both direct and indirect connections to the thalamus viathe reticular formation in the medulla and the pons. From the thalamus, there are projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, the dorsalanterior insular cortex, and the anterior cingulate gyrus (E. G. Jones, 1985).\nTactile and proprioceptive information is transmitted to the cerebral cortex via the central axons of dorsal root ganglion cells, the \ufb01rst-order\nneurons, that enter the spinal cord. These axons ascend directly to the medulla through the ipsilateral dorsal columns, in what is known as thedorsalcol umn \u2014medial lemniscal system. The two sensory modalities are segregated anatomically , with axons from proprioceptors being\nlocated more ventrally in the dorsal columns than are axons from tactile receptors, which are positioned dorsally. Not all of these primary\nafferent \ufb01bers reach the medulla; some 50% terminate at spinal levels and are known as propriospinal \ufb01bers. At higher spinal levels, the dorsal\ncolumns are divided into two fascicles: the gracile fascicle and the cuneate fascicle. The gracile fascicle ascends medially and includes \ufb01bers\nfrom the ipsilateral sacral, lumbar, and lower thoracic segments, whereas the cuneate fascicle ascends laterally and contains \ufb01bers from the\nupper thoracic and cervical segments. Axons in these fascicles terminate in the second-order neurons in the gracile nucleus and cuneatenucleus in the medulla (Florence, Wall, & Kaas, 1989).

Figure 3.11 shows the enlargement of the\ncorticalterritory of the stimul ated \ufb01nger as compared to its normal territory prior to differential stimulation. In a related human study of the\ncorticalhand representation of pro \ufb01cient Braille readers, Pascual-Leone and Torres (1993) used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to\nshow that the corticalrepresentation of the right index (reading) \ufb01nger was signi \ufb01cantly larger than that of the left index \ufb01nger of Braille\nreaders and of the right index \ufb01nger of controlsubjects. Moreover, representations of parts of the hand that were not invol ved in reading\nBraille were differentially smaller than those of control subjects. These results were con \ufb01rmed in another study that used magnetoen-\ncephalography (MEG) to image the cortical representations of the \ufb01ngers of string-instrument players (Elbert, Pantev , Wienbruch, Rockstroh,\n& Taub, 1995). When playing, these musicians are continuously \ufb01ngering the strings with the second through \ufb01fth digits of the left hand, while\nthe thumb grasps the neck of the instrument and so is not as active as the other digits. Elbert et al. (1995) found that the corticalrepresentation of the digits of the left hand of string players was larger than that of controls and that this difference was smallest for thethumb. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the size of the cortical representation of the \ufb01ngers of the left hand (as inferred\nfrom dipole strength) and the age at which the person began to play the musical instrument.\nIn contrast to this expansion of the corticalrepresentation of the \ufb01ngers with training, when the hand area in the human somatosensory cortex\nbecomes deafferented as a consequence of extensive peripheraldeafferentation (spinalcord injury) or amputation, there is shrinkage in the\narea of the cortex devoted to processing information from the hand.

G.\nJones, 2000).\nAn interesting illusion that is related to the plasticity of cortical representation has been reported during acute anesthesia of the thumb or lips.\nGandevia and Phegan (1999) observed that following complete anesthesia of the digital nerves that innervate the thumb, the perceived size of\nthe thumb increased in magnitude by about 60 \u201370%. In addition, the perceived size of the lips also increased (by 55%), even though the\nadjacent unanesthetized index \ufb01nger did not change in perceived size. A similar result was found when the lips were anesthetized, with the\neffect on the thumb being much smaller (an increase in size by 5%), although still signi \ufb01cant. The latter \ufb01nding may re \ufb02ect the fact that the lips\nwere anesthetized using topical anesthesia, which resulted in a marked but not complete loss of sensory function, unlike the digital nerve block\nthat eliminated all sensory feedback from the thumb. This experience of increased size following anesthesia is often reported by people whohave had dental anesthesia and feel that their lips and lower face are \u201cswollen. \u201d\nThe sensory representations of the thumb and lips are anatomically close in subcortical and cortical sites, and some cells respond to inputs\nfrom both the thumb and lips, so it is not surprising that changes in sensory inputs affected both body parts. The absence of any effect ofthumb anesthesia on the perceived size of the index \ufb01nger is surprising, however, and suggests that the boundaries between the thumb and lip\nrepresentations are less distinct than those between the thumb and index \ufb01nger (Gandevia & Phegan, 1999). The increase in perceived size\nwith anesthesia has been interpreted as resulting from the unmasking of sensory inputs to the primary somatosensory cortex and the\nenlargement in the size of the receptive \ufb01elds of cortical cells representing skin areas adjacent to the anesthetized region, as has been shown to\noccur in monkeys (Calford & Tweedale, 1991). These illusory increases in size appear to be related to the extent of the area that is anesthetized,as they do not occur when the whole arm is anesthetized (Melzack & Bromage, 1973). In this situation, the somatosensory cortex devoted tothe anesthetized region becomes \u201csilent.\u201d\nMotor Cortical Areas\nThe areas of the cerebral cortex that contribute directly to the control of hand movements include the primary motor cortex (Ml, or area 4),\nthe supplementary motor area (SMA, or medial part of area 6), the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA, or part of area 6), and thepremotor cortex (PM, or lateral part of area 6) as shown in \ufb01gure 3.12. There is considerable debate about the number of motor areas in the\nhuman brain, and estimates range from a conservative count of four areas to a more liberal estimate of ten areas (Roland & Zilles, 1996). The\nmotor cortical areas receive inputs from subcortical motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, via the thalamus.

This indicates that many corticalmotor neurons in \ufb02uence more than one\n\ufb01nger muscle and that there are widespread horizontal connections throughout the M1 hand area (Donoghue et al., 1992; Schieber & Hibbard,\n1993).\nSimilar results have been obtained from imaging studies of motor cortex organization in the human brain.

Reprinted from Krakauer & Ghez, 2000, with the permission of McGraw-Hill.\nThere are additional representations of the hand in the supplementary motor and premotor areas. These nonprimary motor areas are believed\nto control different aspects of hand function but to operate cooperatively (Rouiller, 1996). In both human and nonhuman primates, the pre-SMA is now regarded as an area distinct from the caudally adjacent SMA on both anatomical and physiological grounds (Picard & Strick,1996; Tanji, 1996). The two areas differ in their anatomicalconnectivity in that onl y the pre-SMA receives substantialinput from thedorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and only the SMA projects directly to the primary motor cortex (Tanji, 1996). Studies of neuronal activity in the\npre-SMA in monkeys suggest that this area plays a role in updating the information that is required to perform an upcoming sequence of\nmovements, and so the neurons in this area are more active during the preparation for upcoming movements (Matsuzaka, Aizawa, & Tanji,\n1992; Shima, Mushiake, Saito, & Tanji, 1996). Similar studies in the SMA reveal that it contributes to planning and controlling sequentialmovements that have multiple spatial components and in particular to arranging multiple movements in the correct temporal order (Shima &Tanji, 1998). The results from imaging studies in human subjects are consistent with this distinction in that they have shown that there is\nsharply localized activity in the pre-SMA while participants are learning a \ufb01nger-sequencing task, whereas the SMA becomes more active\nduring the performance of these sequentialmovements (Boecker et al ., 1998; Hikosaka, Sakai, Miyauchi, Takino, Sasaki, & P \u00fctz, 1996).\nThe PM appears to be involved in the planning and control of movements that are guided by sensory information (Roland & Zilles, 1996).\nSeverall ines of evidence from nonhuman primate studies suggest that the ventralpremotor cortex can be distinguished from the dorsal\npremotor cortex both functionally and structurally. In particular, the ventral premotor cortex participates in the visual guidance of hand\nmovements, such as those involved in reaching for and manipulating objects (Ochiai, Mushiake, & Tanji, 2005; Wise, di Pellegrino, &Boussaoud, 1992). Behavioraland imaging studies in both human and nonhuman primates suggest that one rol e of this corticalarea is the\ntransformation of information about the location of objects in space, which is speci \ufb01ed in an extrinsic visualframe of reference, into an\nintrinsic motor reference frame (Kakei, Hoffman, & Strick, 2001). In contrast, the dorsal premotor cortex is involved in movement planningand the mental rehearsal and observation of motor tasks (Ramnani & Miall, 2004). Many task-related neurons in this cortical area exhibit thesame activity patterns during observation as during performance of a task (Cisek & Kalaska, 2004, 2005).\nAll of these cortical motor areas project to the spinal cord, and in human and nonhuman primates, a subset of the neurons in the primary\nmotor cortex, known as corticomotoneuronal cells, send their axons directly to the distal motoneurons that innervate hand and \ufb01nger muscles.\nAbout 40% of the axons in the human corticospinaltract originate in the primary motor cortex, and these axons descend through the\nsubcorticalwhite", "doc_id": "bb54cb44-45a9-4b36-86e8-356c5ab12a09", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a97f614f640a31f27835e88e824753a5e91db1a15fe02460eed4d89db14ed422", "extra_info": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3619}, "relationships": {"1": "16683474-cb4d-443f-b70e-959d5b295a2a", "3": "6940cb3a-1ab5-41d1-aad9-16e8a1f0ae94"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6940cb3a-1ab5-41d1-aad9-16e8a1f0ae94": {"__data__": {"text": "movement planningand the mental rehearsal and observation of motor tasks (Ramnani & Miall, 2004).

(2004) have shown that after\ncomplete transection of the direct (monosynaptic) corticomotoneuronal pathway (at C4/C5), monkeys could still grasp small morsels of foodby using independent \ufb01nger movements. These animals did show persistent de \ufb01cits in preshaping the hand when grasping the food and had\ndif\ufb01culties in controlling the force between the index \ufb01nger and thumb. These \ufb01ndings indicate that indirect as well as direct\ncorticomotoneuronalpathways are invol ved in prehension and in the controlof independent \ufb01nger movements.\nAs was noted for the somatosensory cortex, the somatotopic organization of the motor cortex is dynamic and can change following injury or\nwhen learning new motor skills (for a review, see Sanes & Donoghue, 2000). Studies of the motor cortex of people who have had an upperlimb amputated, either traumatically or surgically, or who were born without the limb have revealed that muscles adjacent to the stump can be\nactivated (using TMS) from a larger area of cortex than those on the contralateral side. In addition, the threshold for activating muscles is\nlower on the amputated side (Cohen, Bandinelli, Findley, & Hallett, 1991; Hall, Flament, Fraser, & Lemon, 1990). In this situation, the musclesin the limb adjacent to the stump are controlled by a larger area of cortex that presumably became silent following amputation.\nThe effects of motor learning on the cortical representation of the hand in human primary motor cortex have been examined using \ufb01nger-\nsequencing tasks. These studies have shown that changes in M1 can occur within 20 \u201330 minutes of learning a task (Classen, Liepert, Wise,\nHallett, & Cohen, 1998) but can revert back to baseline levels when the task is no longer performed, even for well-practiced skills, such asreading Braille (Pascual-Leone, Wassermann, Sadato, & Hallett, 1995). Using a simple motor task that involved touching the thumb to the tipof each \ufb01nger in a prescribed sequence, Karni et al. (1995) studied the short- and longer-term (5 weeks) effects of motor learning on the\ncorticalrepresentation of the hand.

It appears that over the time that the skill was acquired, synaptic connections between neurons in primarymotor cortex were unmasked and strengthened, so that a larger cortical network of neurons became involved in the task performance.\nThe continuous modi \ufb01cations of the motor cortex that occur with different manualexperiences have important impl ications for\nunderstanding the acquisition and retention of motor skills.

The\nthousands of times with which \ufb01nger movements are repeated by skilled typists and pianists no doubt reinforces particular networks in the\nmotor cortex. These connections remain strong with practice, which presumably accounts for the retention of these skills with age, while othermotor skills deteriorate (see chapter 9).Neurophysiology of Hand Function 43", "doc_id": "a4f069f9-55b2-4563-af55-bd0646fec421", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "80610b822ba4e493c1066d6bced1411023806bb9cbadb11b5ab011b8533780f7", "extra_info": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2817, "end": 4859}, "relationships": {"1": "45112f74-5cc1-45b3-b83d-de62960cc3e9", "2": "bf9833fa-206b-4cb5-ac66-934157041ca8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "09ee08e5-0a4a-4a05-a26d-1e985ed9e927": {"__data__": {"text": "4\nTactile Sensing\nDespitethefactthattheskinis,fromtheevolutionarystandpoint,theoldestofthesensitivetissuesofthebody,ithasyieldedupitssecretsreluc tantly .\nGELDARD , 1972\nIn chapters 2 and 3, we considered the anatomy and sensory neurophysiology of the hand. In the next four chapters, we turn to the research\nliterature on manual performance. Tasks are categorized in terms of how they differentiate hand function along the sensory-motor continuum\nintroduced in chapter 1 ( \ufb01gure 1.1). Chapters 4 and 5 address the sensory performance of the hand based on tasks that involve tactile sensing\nand active haptic sensing, respectively . Chapters 6 and 7 address motor performance based on tasks involving prehension (reaching andgrasping) and non-prehensile skilled activities, respectively . The primary objective of these chapters is to review the extensive, but highlydiverse and often uneven, literature on human hand function. We highlight issues and concerns that we believe to be critical to any discussionof hand function, describe selected studies in each of the four categories along the sensory-motor continuum together with the methodologiesused to study them, note important controlparameters that may affect performance, and provide additionalreferences for the reader topursue a speci \ufb01c topic in greater depth.\nWithin the domain of tactile sensing, it is important to distinguish between tasks that involve stimulating the stationary hand with a stationary\nobject ( \u201cpassive static \u201d) and tasks that involve an external agent moving an object across the stationary hand ( \u201cpassive movement \u201d). Passive-\nstatic tasks activate fast-adapting mechanoreceptor units at the beginning of the contact period, and sometimes at the end as well. Slow-adapting units respond to initialcontact and continue to respond throughout the contact period. Passive-movement tasks activate the sl ow-adapting units even more vigorously (Johnson & Lamb, 1981); in addition, the fast-adapting mechanoreceptor populations are activated byvibrations produced by the relative motion between skin and object.\nSensitivity and Resolution\nAny discussion of human hand function must consider both the hand's sensitivity to various forms of mechanical, thermal, andelectrocutaneous stimulation and its spatial and temporal resolving capacities.

Investigators have considered a number of dimensions that are relevant to mechanical, thermal, and\nelectrical stimuli. The reader should consult Sherrick and Cholewiak (1986) and Greenspan and Bolanowski (1996) for more detailed\ndiscussions of this topic.\nSensitivity\nPressure\nThe pressure threshold is the most common intensive measure of absolute tactile sensitivity (i.e., the smallest intensity that is just detectable).\nNylon mono \ufb01laments of varying diameters are most often used to apply controlled pressure to a designated site on the stationary hand.\nTypically, some variant of the psychophysical method of limits is used to determine the absolute threshold. Observers must indicate whetheror not they detect the presence of a \ufb01lament applied to the skin. On alternating series of trials, the pressure is decreased or increased until a\nthreshold is reached (for further methodological details, see Gescheider, 1997). Body site and gender both in \ufb02uence sensitivity to pressure: for\nmen, normal mean threshold values average about 0.158 g on the palm and about 0.055 g on the \ufb01ngertips; the corresponding values for\nwomen are consistently lower, namely, 0.032 g and 0.019 g (Weinstein, 1968). In keeping with the literature on cutaneous pressure sensitivity,we report the values in grams. It should be noted that \ufb01gures 10.2 and 10.3 in the originalWeinstein articl e both represent force in units of\nlog10F0.1mg. The mean force values for men and women above, which were derived from these two \ufb01gures, were converted to grams by\ndividing by 10\n4. Although Weinstein's mono \ufb01laments were calibrated in terms of force, Levin, Pearsall, and Ruderman (1978) have argued that\nstress (force per unit area) is the more appropriate variable to use when measuring pressure sensitivity.\nIntensity difference thresholds (i.e., the smallest perceptible difference in intensity between two stimuli) for taps generated by 2-ms square\nwaves have also been reported (Craig, 1972). The taps were controlled using a pulse generator and imposed on a vibrator contacting the rightindex\ufb01nger. Four standard intensity values (14, 21, 28, and 35 dB SL, where sensation level at threshold is measured in voltage and de \ufb01ned as\n0 dB SL) were evaluated. The procedure used to determine the difference thresholds for intensity combined a two-interval, temporal forced-choice paradigm with a blocked up-and-down method (Campbell, 1963). Observers were required to choose which tap felt more intense. Theresults are shown in \ufb01gure 4.1. The unit of measure for the Y axis is the difference in attenuator settings for the standard and comparison\nstimuli, measured in dB and plotted as a function of the sensation level in dB, rather than the more traditional Weber fraction. If these ratio\nvalues were plotted in terms of the Weber fraction ( \u0394I/I) as a function of intensity (amplitude), they would con \ufb01rm what has been commonly\nfound with respect to Weber's law, namely that, except for low intensity levels, the Weber fraction for intensity remains relatively constant asthe sensation level of the standard stimulus is increased (Craig, 1974).\nThe results of many studies collectively show that the cutaneous system effectively resolves normal forces applied to the skin and that humans\nare capable of scaling the magnitude of such forces (e.g., Burgess, Mei, Tuckett, Horch, Ballinger, & Poulos, 1983; Cohen & Vierck, 1993;H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen & J\u00e4rvilehto, 1981; Knibest\u00f6l & Vallbo, 1980).

Harju (2002) used a simpli \ufb01ed version of the method-of-limits procedure (discussed earlier) to determine absolute\nthreshold from a baseline skin temperature of 33 \u00b0C on the thenar eminence. Observers were asked to indicate when they \ufb01rst detected a warm\nor cold event. Healthy males and females of two different age ranges (20 \u201330 years and 55 \u201365 years) served as observers. At this site, neither\ngender nor age differences were noted for the warm thresholds (34.4 \u00b0C); however, cold thresholds for men (28.8 \u00b0C) were higher than those\nfor women (28.1 \u00b0C). It is likely that the discrepancies with the results obtained by Stevens and Choo (1998) derive primarily from the relative\nprecision of the methodologies used. Nevertheless, both studies con \ufb01rm that the hand is more sensitive to cold than to warmth.\nRelative sensitivities to warmth and cold have also been investigated by measuring the difference thresholds (at 75% accuracy) for resolving a\nchange in intensity between a pair of warming or cooling pulses sequentially applied to the thenar eminence (Johnson, Darian-Smith, LaMotte,\nJohnson, & Old- \ufb01eld, 1979). To investigate relative sensitivity to thermal warming, the skin was maintained at baseline temperatures of 29, 34,\nor 39\u00b0C for at least 10 min before testing. A range of standard amplitude steps for the warming pulse relative to the baseline temperature was\nevaluated. Calculation of the optimal difference threshold for warming pulses was based on the \ufb01ve lowest values obtained at each standard\nintensity level. The difference thresholds for baseline temperatures of 34 \u00b0C and 39 \u00b0C were very small, that is, rarely more than 0.050 \u00b0C, while\nthose for a baseline of 29 \u00b0C were only a little higher, no more than 0.075 \u00b0C. An earlier study (Johnson et al., 1973) used a similar approach to\nevaluate relative sensitivity to cooling pulses on the thenar eminence. Regardless of baseline temperature (29 \u201341\u00b0C), the difference thresholds\nfor cooling pulses varied linearly from a mean of 0.072 \u00b0C for a 0.5 \u00b0C step to 0.206 \u00b0C for an 8 \u00b0C step.\nThe rates of growth of warm and cold sensations have also been examined with a psychophysical procedure known as \u201cmagnitude estimation.\n\u201dThe observer is required to assign the number that best matches the perceived magnitude of the percept being judged, in this case, warmth\nor cold.

However, the exponents of the magnitude estimation functions for warmth do vary considerably with\nboth stimulus size and site of stimulation (Stevens & Marks, 1971). The thermal growth function obtained by magnitude estimation potentially\noffers clinicians a new diagnostic tool for assessing thermal sensitivity on the hand.\nWhen skin temperature changes very slowly (i.e., < 0.5 \u00b0C/min), an alteration of less than 5 \u20136\u00b0C may not be detected by an observer, provided\nthat the temperature remains within the neutralzone of 30 \u201336\u00b0C. However, when the change occurs more rapidly (e.g., 0.1 \u00b0C/s), small\nincreases and decreases in skin temperature are perceived (Kenshalo, Holmes, & Wood, 1968).\nSpatial features of the thermal stimulus (e.g., the area and its shape) are poorly resolved, and changes in intensity within the region of\nstimulation are poorly detected. Low spatial resolution occurs because the skin summates thermal intensity over space, a process labeled spatial\nsummation. Spatial summation occurs at absolute threshold, but may also be experienced at levels above threshold, as shown by the following\nsimple demonstration. First, press the edge of a coin that has been warmed (or cooled) into the skin; then, repeat the process using one of its\n\ufb02at faces. It is important to avoid altering the thermal experience by touching the coin with the other \ufb01ngers. By switching from the edge to the\n\ufb02at region of the coin, the magnitude of warmth (cold) experienced markedly increases, as noted by Sherrick and Cholewiak (1986). More\nrecently, Green and Zaharchuk (2001) have reported that about two thirds of the spatial summation of warmth may be attributed to thespatially nonuniform thermal sensitivity of the skin. Increasing the size of the stimulus thus increases the likelihood of stimulating regions withgreater sensitivity. Accordingly, neural summation may play only a modest role in producing the overall amount of summation observed inpsychophysical studies. Almost complete temporal summation (i.e., the summation of warmth over time) occurs on the forehead over a range\nof temporaldurations from 0.5 to 1.0 s, with no further effect up to 10 s (Stevens, Okul icz, & Marks, 1973). We know of no scienti \ufb01c studies\nthat have parametrically assessed either temporal or spatial summation effects on the hand. Although both summation effects are likely tooccur, there may well be differences between the hand and other body regions.\nIn closing this section, we note that when the skin is warmed or cooled as a result of touching an object, the location and extent of the thermal\nstimulus can be determined on the basis of the tactile input (e.g., Green, 1977). We will discuss this phenomenon in greater detail when weconsider spatialacuity.\nElectrocutaneous Stimulation\nElectrocutaneous thresholds describe the sensitivity of the skin to electrical stimulation. Note that the skin's receptors do not sense electricalstimulation because the nerve is stimulated directly. The absolute threshold for electrical stimulation is strongly in \ufb02uenced by the type of\nelectrode and its con \ufb01guration, as well as by the locus of stimulation, wave form, repetition rate, and the individual observer.

For\nexample, greater-than-complete summation, or supersummation, occurs at low sensation levels, whereas complete spatial summation occurs athigh sensation levels (Higashiyama & Tashiro, 1990,1993a).\nInvestigators have also determined the difference threshold for intensity of electrocutaneous sinusoidal stimulation.

The dynamic range from threshold to\npain for electrical stimulation is only about 15 dB, which is considerably narrower than the corresponding 60 \u201380 dB dynamic range measured\nfor vibrotactile stimulation (Geldard, 1972).\nThe rate of growth of electrocutaneous sensation has typically been assessed by using the magnitude-estimation procedure to estimate the\nperceived magnitude of suprathreshold stimuli. A power function is usually obtained, although the value of the exponent has varied. Theresults of an early experiment by S. S. Stevens, Carton, and Shickman (1958) are shown in \ufb01gure 4.3. The 60 Hz stimuli, which were either 0.5\nor 1 s in duration and varied from 0.25 to 1.10 mA, were delivered through electrodes to the index and ring \ufb01ngers. The rate of growth of\nperceived current amplitude for the data combined across duration levels was exceptionally high (compared to other sensory tasks) as revealed\nby the exponent of the power function, which was 3.5. Since then, other researchers have obtained exponents that are considerably lower andthat vary somewhat across studies (e.g., Babkoff, 1978; Cross, Tursky, & Lodge, 1975; Rollman & Harris, 1987). The results of a study by\nHigashiyama and Tashiro (1989) suggest that the diversity in exponent values may be attributed to differences in current level inasmuch as thevalue of the exponent is higher for low current values than for high current values. To the extent that this suggestion is true, the relationbetween perceived intensity and current cannot be described by a simple power function.\nVibration\nThere is a considerable body of psychophysical research that has evaluated the sensitivity of the hand to vibrotactile stimulation. Althoughmuch of this research has been performed on the thenar eminence, data do exist for the \ufb01ngertip (e.g., Gescheider, Bolanowski, Pope, &\nVerrillo, 2002; Verrillo, 1971) as shown in \ufb01gure 4.4. Typically, vibration is delivered via a contactor mounted on a mini-shaker. A rigid\nsurround with a small gap separating the contactor from the surround (e.g., 1 mm) is often used to prevent any traveling-wave effects on theskin. Verrillo (1963) \ufb01rst described a two-limbed psychophysical function for vibrotactile thresholds as a function of frequency (25 \u2013700 Hz).\nAt lower frequencies (25 \u201340 Hz), the psychophysicalfunction was rel ativel y \ufb02at;48 Tactile Sensing", "doc_id": "ec0ef243-d982-4735-87dc-d7b68750723c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "48fa4b328e567caed45a87e6774c629343fc05cdc76bbec9deb2ee9ef1131982", "extra_info": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3198}, "relationships": {"1": "13d46451-ba22-44be-9073-b3a559e4e57b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b5daba-dc5d-4493-b0bc-167e7f92901a": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 4.3.

However, beyond that frequency range the psychophysical function was U-shaped,\nwith the threshold progressively declining up to approximately 250 Hz, at which point it began to increase up to 700 Hz. These initial\npsychophysical results led Verrillo to propose a two-channel theory of vibrotactile sensitivity, with each channel (non-Pacinian, or NP , and\nPacinian, or PC) presumably mediated by a different population of tactile units, as suggested later by Talbot et al. (1968). The low-frequency,non-Pacinian channelshowed no spatialor temporalsummation, in contrast to the high-frequency, Pacinian channel , which demonstratedboth forms of summation.\nConverging psychophysical paradigms (selective adaptation, masking, and enhancement) were subsequently used to uncover the full frequency\nresponse of each vibrotactile channel, since Verrillo and his colleagues suspected that only the more sensitive channel mediates thepsychophysical threshold responses. Selective adaptation was used to show selective-fatigue effects within, but not across, the NP and PCchannels. With this paradigm, the skin is adapted to high-intensity stimulation at the channel's most sensitive frequency in order to reveal the\nresponse of the normally less sensitive channel (Verrillo & Gescheider, 1977). Temporal masking has also been used to con \ufb01rm the hypothesis\nthat vibrotactile detection is mediated by at least two receptor systems that do not mask one another (e.g., Gescheider, Verrillo, & Van Doren,1982).

In keeping with the predictions, within-channelmasking effects were observed; however, no cross-channeleffects occurred, asevident in \ufb01gure 4.5A. Additionalsupport has been obtained using the enhancement paradigm, which consists of presenting three brief (20\nms) sinusoidal bursts in turn: a conditioning stimulus followed after a variable interval by a test stimulus (10 dB SL), followed 750 ms later by amatching stimulus, whose intensity is controlled by the observer. The observer must match the perceived intensity of the test stimulus in thepresence of the conditioning stimulus (Verrillo & Gescheider, 1975). The effect of the conditioning stimulus is determined by calculating thedifference between this match and a control match that does not include the conditioning stimulus. The frequencies of the conditioning and\ntest stimuli were chosen from the same vibrotactile channel (e.g., 300 \u2013300\u2013300 Hz) or from different channels (e.g., 25 \u2013300\u2013300 Hz).

Stimulation of any one mechanoreceptor\npopulation results in a unique \u201cunitary \u201dsensation, similar to the scotopic (rods) and photopic (three populations of cones) systems in vision.\nTwo assumptions are made. First, the channelwith the greatest sensitivity processes threshol d sensations. Second, more than one activatedpsychophysical channel is responsible for producing suprathreshold sensations, although it can be as few as two. The outputs of all activatedchannels are presumably combined to produce a unitary sensation at cortical levels higher than area SI. Table 4.1 summarizes the essential\npsychophysicalcharacteristics of each channel .\nRecently , the four-channel model has been applied to the vibrotactile sensitivity of the \ufb01ngertip, based on tests of frequency selectivity,\ntemporal summation, and spatial summation (Gescheider et al., 2002). The only difference between tests on the two body sites is that the\namount of spatial summation, as determined by the reduced effect of contactor size, is relatively lower on the \ufb01ngertip. The modelhas al so\nbeen applied to the vibrotactile sensations that arise in response to the stimulation of hairy skin with vibratory stimuli, as previously discussedin chapter 3.\nIt is important to note the following caveat concerning the multichannel models for glabrous and hairy skin proposed by Bolanowski and his\ncolleagues. These researchers make the general claim that their model mediates the \u201cmechanicalaspects of touch. \u201dWhile making a noteworthy\ncontribution to our understanding of vibrotactile sensations, we emphasize that this model does not address the many other types ofsigni\ufb01cant mechanical sensations that result from statically stimulating the skin or from applying spatially varying surfaces perpendicularly onto\nor tangentially across the skin.\nAs previously reported with mechanical taps, Craig (1974) also showed that when vibrotactile intensity discrimination is evaluated using a\nstandard stimulus of 160 Hz presented in 200-ms bursts, the Weber fraction remains relatively constant as a function of increasing sensationlevel (in dB, relative to absolute threshold), except at very low levels of intensity.\nThe perceived magnitude of a 60-Hz vibration delivered to the \ufb01ngertip grows as a power function of the vibrotactile intensity with an\nexponent of 0.95 (S. S. Stevens, 1959). The exponent of the function is in \ufb02uenced by many of the same factors that affect the absolute\nthreshold (e.g., site of stimulation, contactor area, age). The effect of frequency on the value of the exponent has proved to be controversial.For example, both S. S. Stevens (1975; also see \ufb01gure 4.6) and Marks (1979) have shown that frequency in \ufb02uences the exponent, whereas\nVerrillo and Capraro (1975) have shown no such effect. Methodological differences may be responsible for such discrepancies.\nThe hand is also susceptible to vibrotactile \u201cafter-effects. \u201dFor example, when the skin is stimulated by an intense vibrotactile adapting stimulus\nof a given frequency for 1 \u20132 min, the threshold for a neutral test stimulus (vibration of the same frequency) is lower than when the adapting\nstimulus has not been presented, demonstrating what is known as a negative aftereffect. (Sometimes, however, observers report that the teststimulus feels more intense following exposure to the adapting stimulus, that is, a positive aftereffect.)

The most traditionaltest, known as the two-point touch\nthreshold, measures the smallest gap between two points contacting the skin that are experienced as two separate tactile sensations. Normal\nthreshold values tend to be about 2 \u20134 mm on the \ufb01ngertips and about 10 \u201311 mm on the palm (Weinstein, 1968). Researchers have long\nrecognized that there are a number of parameters that may affect spatial acuity, including applied force, the areal extent of the pointscontacting the skin, and the criteria used to judge the number of sensations experienced. Figure 4.7 shows the mean two-point thresholds for\ndifferent regions on the hand averaged over the left and right sides for females (panel A) and for males (panel B) (Weinstein, 1968). The mostconsistent difference between the palm and the \ufb01ve digits is that the digits resolve spatial detail more precisely than the palm does.\nJohnson and Phillips (1981: also see Craig, 1999) have questioned the validity of using the two-point touch threshold as a measure of spatial\nacuity.

Revised from Weinstein, 1968.\nLocalization of thermal sensations is known to be very poor compared to localization of tactile stimuli (Taus, Stevens, & Marks, 1975). It is\nvery dif \ufb01cult to differentiate spatially two thermal stimuli owing to the fact that thermal stimulation summates spatially (Cain, 1973).\nFunctional interactions between the thermal and tactile modalities are known to occur. For example, Green (1977) demonstrated a fascinating\nthermal illusion in which observers were required to feel three thermal stimulators with the middle three \ufb01ngers of one hand. The outer two\nwere warm (or cool), while the middle one was thermally neutral. Observers clearly experienced warm (or cool) sensations on all three\ufb01ngertips. Thus, the thermalsensations experienced directl y at the outer \ufb01ngers were also \u201creferred \u201dor misdirected spatially to the middle\n\ufb01nger, the site of the thermally neutral stimulus. A simple demonstration of the illusion may be produced by warming coins on a radiator or\ncooling them in a refrigerator. The illusion is depicted in \ufb01gure 4.9. To summarize, when there was a spatialdiscrepancy between tactil e and\nthermal patterns on the skin, the more spatially acute tactile sense dominated the less spatially acute thermal sense.\nFinally, we consider the relative localization accuracy of electrocutaneous sensations in the hand. Higashiyama and Hayashi (1993) assessed the\nextent to which observers could localize such stimuli on the palmar surface of the middle three \ufb01ngers using two types of electrode\ncon\ufb01guration. In the unifocalcon \ufb01guration, the anodal electrode was placed on the instep of the right foot, whereas the cathodal electrodes\nwere placed at the targeted sites of study on the hand. In the concentric con \ufb01guration, the distance between the cathodaland anodalel ectrodes\nwas considerably smaller, being concentrically arranged in inner and outer disks, respectively. The site of stimulation varied across and within\nthe middle three \ufb01ngers of the right hand. Observers were required to select the apparent location of each pulse from a speci \ufb01ed set of body\nsites on the \ufb01ngers and wrist. For the unifocalcon \ufb01guration, localization was poor when the stimulating sites were on the middle \ufb01nger (i.e.,\nthree phalanges) and relatively high for stimulating sites on the tips of either the index or ring \ufb01nger; however, localization was relatively good\nacross the \ufb01ngers. In contrast, localization was very good for all stimulating sites when the concentric con \ufb01guration was used.\nA second study explored within- \ufb01nger localization more thoroughly by using three stimulating sites within each of the index, ring, and middle\n\ufb01ngers with both types of electrode con \ufb01guration. As before, with the unifocalcon \ufb01guration, the errors were large. Localization was very poor\non the proximal phalanx of all three \ufb01ngers followed by the distal phalanx, whereas the middle phalanges showed little or no error. Thus, there\nwas no clear proximal to distal gradient. In addition, localization errors on the proximal and distal phalanges were both biased toward the\nmiddle phalanx. In contrast, with the concentric con \ufb01guration, localization was either very precise or biased a little toward the palm.

Various psychophysical\nmethods have been used to address this issue. For example, the threshold for judging the successiveness of mechanical pulses (i.e., for\nperceiving two as opposed to one pulse) is approximately 5 ms for the skin (Gescheider, 1974), whereas the temporal acuity for\nelectrocutaneous pulses is about 50 ms, and therefore much inferior to mechanical touch (Higashiyama & Tashiro, 1988; Rosner, 1961).\nHow do the results describing the sensory resolving capacity of the hand compare to that of the eye or the ear? The visual system is clearly the\nmost spatially acute sense, being able to resolve spatial differences between two points as \ufb01ne as 1 min of arc under fovealviewing (Howard,\n1982). In contrast, the auditory system can only localize a 1000 Hz target presented at varying angular distances from the median plane of thehead to within about 1 \u00b0(Mills, 1958). A comparable measure of tactile acuity is the two-point touch threshold. For the tongue, the most\nFigure 4.9. A thermal illusion may be easily generated, as described in the text.

However, as angular measures are not applicable to a\ncontact sense, it is dif \ufb01cult to compare this value directly with the angular values for either audition or vision. With respect to temporal\nresolving capacity , the visual system can determine the successiveness of two pulses separated by about 25 ms, whereas the auditory systemrequires only 0.01 ms (Sherrick & Cholewiak, 1986). With a corresponding value of 5 ms, mechanical touch lies in an intermediate rangebetween vision and audition, with audition being best and vision the worst. Numerousness, that is, the ability of the observer to countaccurately a series of sensory events (visual, auditory, or tactile) presented within a given time period produces a similar temporal ordering of\nthe senses (Lechelt, 1975). Such results are likely important when considering issues pertaining to the nature of multisensory integration (see\nCalvert, Stein, & Spence, 2004) and the design of multimodal interfaces for teleoperation and virtual environment systems (see chapter 10).\nTactile Motion\nStudies have shown that stimulus movement across the skin can be detected by a passive observer in terms of its presence, location, direction,and speed (Bender, Stacy, & Cohen, 1982). For example, psychophysical studies that used brushes, edges, and probes to produce realcontinuous movement on the human hand have shown that discriminating the direction of stimulation depends on both the distance movedand the stimulus velocity (Essick, Franzen, & Whitsel, 1988; Norsell & Olausson, 1992).\nIn addition to the sensation of tactile motion that results from real movement across the skin, an illusory sensation of motion may also be\nproduced, in this case, by delivering a series of pulses to adjacent locations in quick temporal succession (Kirman, 1974; Sherrick & Rogers,\n1966). Smooth apparent motion, or beta motion, is detected at various sites (e.g., the back) when two tactile stimuli (optimally, periodic such as\n150 Hz) are delivered to two different sites on the skin. The stimulus appears to move between the two contact sites when the interval between\nstimulus onset falls within a certain range. The interval that is optimal for beta motion is a nonmonotonic function of the duration of the \ufb01rst\nstimulus, as in vision (Lakatos & Shepard, 1997; Sherrick & Rogers, 1966). For detailed comparison of the conditions under which tactile andvisual apparent motion occur, the reader should consult Sherrick and Cholewiak (1986).\nGardner and Sklar (1994) have produced apparent motion on the \ufb01ngers using a reading device for the blind known as the Optacon ( \ufb01gure\n4.10) to assess the contribution of spatial and temporal properties of a moving tactile stimulus to the perceived direction of motion (for furtherdetails about the Optacon, see Bliss, Katcher, Rogers, & Shepard, 1970).

Do we \ufb01nd a similar illusory phenomenon on the skin? The results have been mixed. Hollins and Favorov\n(1994) con \ufb01rmed the presence of a strong tactile motion aftereffect, which increases in magnitude and vividness with the duration of the\nadapting stimulus. In one study, observers placed their hands on a cylinder that was rotating at a rate of 280 mm/s, to which were attached\nraised, square-wave stripes of low spatial frequency covered with smooth adhesive tape. They experienced a vivid and reliable negative motionaftereffect that was very similar to what has been previously documented with vision. Hollins and Favorov explained the phenomenon using amodel of cortical dynamics proposed by Whitsel and his colleagues (Whitsel, Favorov, Kelly, & Tommerdahl, 1991; Whitsel, Favorov ,Tommerdahl,Tactile Sensing 57", "doc_id": "24329685-25aa-415c-bdf3-fbd106b7d117", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5be20b5dee3fc85e96599f29dbc70f826d6b835c0851bcadd9652da7402f23c3", "extra_info": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2996, "end": 4864}, "relationships": {"1": "7097139d-0000-472d-be65-6509dc236e66", "2": "a2962e05-2b76-4fe3-bd1d-c4566d67531c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b0e337b-0e39-4959-b70c-367854dd3ec4": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 4.10.

In brief, the adapting stimulus tunes the responses of directionally sensitive somatosensory cortical neurons.\nWhen the adapting stimulus is replaced with a stationary stimulus, which in the unadapted state is presumed to elicit equal activity in neurons\nselectively sensitive to all directions of motion, the activity-weighted mean response of the adapted cortical network is displaced away from the\ndirection of the movement of the adapting stimulus. It has been proposed that the observer interprets this as a shift in perceived movement ina direction opposite to that of the adapting stimulus. Unfortunately, researchers have not always been able to produce the tactile aftereffectreliably, as noted both by Hollins and Favorov (1994) and more recently by Lerner and Craig (2002).\nSpace-Time Interactions in Somatosensory Processing\nResearch has shown strong space-time interdependence with regard to visual, auditory, and also somatosensory processing. For example, thetau effect refers to the fact that the apparent distance between three equally spaced stimuli that are presented successively on the forearmdepends upon the intervening temporalinterval(Hel son & King, 1931). More speci \ufb01cally, if the time between the \ufb01rst and second stimuli is\nshorter (longer) than the time between the second and third stimuli, people judge the corresponding distance between the \ufb01rst and second\nstimuli to be shorter (longer) than the physically equal distance between the second and third stimuli. This effect has been demonstrated in all\nthree modalities. The converse effect, known as kappa, refers to the fact that the apparent temporal interval between two successively\npresented stimuli depends upon their spatial separation. Speci \ufb01cally, the temporal interval is perceived to increase with increasing spatial extent.\nAlthough this perceptual phenomenon has been con \ufb01rmed with respect to audition (Cohen, Hansel, & Sylvester, 1954) and vision (Cohen,\nHansel, & Sylvester, 1953), it has not been demonstrated in the tactile domain (Yoblick & Salvendy , 1970). Moreover, none of the work to datehas selected the hand as a site of stimulation. The occurrence of tactile tau and kappa should be explicitly evaluated with respect to the hand.Any successful theory of tactile space perception must be able to account for such space-time interactions.\nA different but striking space-time interaction known as the saltation effect involves the illusory displacement of tactile stimuli (Geldard &\nSherrick, 1972). By way of a simple demonstration, consider the placement of three identical contactors spaced about 10 cm apart on the\nforearm. A sequence of 15 very brief taps is initiated starting with the \ufb01rst contactor and ending with the third one, with each of the three in\nturn receiving 5 taps with no additionaltemporalgap between the stimul ation of successive contactors.

In contrast, when they actively explore the stimulus (active touch), their perceptual experiences tend to bedirected toward the externalobject and its properties (Gibson, 1962). With passive touch, the initialsensory inputs are provided sol el y by theperipheral populations of mechanoreceptive and thermal units, and they are subsequently integrated at higher levels of the nervous system (i.e.,\ntactile sensing). Nevertheless, it is still possible to use tactile sensing to extract useful, albeit limited, information about the external world .\nKlatzky and Lederman (1993) have suggested that tangible object properties may be hierarchically organized into two major categories: (a)\nmaterial(e.g., texture, compl iance, and thermalproperties), and (b) geometry (e.g., size and shape), which occurs at both micro ( \ufb01ngertip) and\nmacro (larger than \ufb01ngertip) levels. Weight re \ufb02ects the contributions of both materialand geometric features since it is partl y determined by\nobject mass, which in turn is the product of object density (a materialfeature) and object vol ume (a geometric feature).\nStationary Versus Moving Stimuli\nWith no relative motion between the \ufb01ngertips and the stimulus surface or object, the discharge rates of SA I units are relatively low (Johnson\n& Lamb, 1981). Moreover, without movement, the sensory experience of surface texture is degraded (Katz, 1925/1989). Subsequent to thesestudies, Hollins, Bensma\u00eda, and Risner (1998) showed more speci \ufb01cally that when relative motion is eliminated, discrimination of relatively\nsmooth surfaces is impaired; in addition, the exponent of the psychophysicalroughness function is reduced. In contrast, the absence of rel ative\nmotion makes coarse surfaces feel smoother, but leaves the corresponding exponent relatively unchanged (Hollins et al., 1998). We will discuss\nthe additional implications of these results for theories of texture perception under the next section, \u201cMaterialProperties. \u201d\nWith no movement, it is still possible to distinguish large intensive changes in material properties relatively quickly. Lederman and Klatzky\n(1997) required observers to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether or not a target (e.g., a very rough surface) was present among\nvarying numbers of distractor items (e.g., very smooth surfaces) presented simultaneously to various combinations of one to six \ufb01ngers\nselected from the middle three \ufb01ngers of both hands.

In contrast, it took relatively more time; sometimes considerably more, to\ndiscriminate large geometric differences; for example, whether a raised dot lay to the left or right of a central indentation, the relative planar\norientation of a raised line, or the relative three-dimensional orientation of a ramp. When observers made their binary perceptual judgments ofa geometric property, they also chose to move their hands actively over the stationary display following initial contact (active haptic sensing).\nMaterial Properties\nSurface Texture\nAn early critical source of information about the tactual perception of surface texture is TheWorldofTouch by David Katz (1925/1989). This\nbook provides a wealth of original, varied, and highly informative observations on texture perception by touch and is based on both carefulphenomenological observations and experimental results.\nIt is important to understand that the perception of texture is multidimensional. Hollins, Faldowski, Rao, and Young (1993) recognized this\npoint by requiring observers to arrange a set of 17 stimulus surfaces into from three to seven groups according to their perceived dissimilarity.Surfaces were moved under an observer's stationary index \ufb01nger. The dissimilarity judgments were then used to construct a perceptual space\nfor texture using multidimensional scaling procedures. The data were \ufb01t reasonably well by a three-dimensional solution, as shown in \ufb01gure\n4.13. Rating judgments of the objects in terms of \ufb01ve adjective scales were obtained from the same observers and used to interpret the three-\ndimensional solution. Roughness/smoothness and hardness/softness proved to be reliable orthogonal dimensions.

In a subsequent study, a sticky/slippery dimension was also observed, although only for someobservers (Hollins, Bensma\u00efa, Karlof, & Young, 2000). Hollins et al. (2000) concluded that the sticky/slippery dimension is less perceptuallysalient than either the rough/smooth or hard/soft dimensions, which were reliably observed in all participants.\nPeople are remarkably good at detecting and discriminating surface textures. For example, a texture composed of either periodically ordered\nbars or dots only a fraction of a micron high (i.e., 0.06 \u03bcm and 0.16 \u03bcm, respectively) is detectable with 75% accuracy when moved laterally\nacross the \ufb01ngerpad (LaMotte & Srinivasan, 1991; cf. 6 \u03bcm for a single dot of 50 \u03bcm diameter and 1 \u03bcm for dots > 500 \u03bcm diameter).\nMoreover, with two-dimensional raised-dot patterns, people can discriminate differences in spatial period (that is, the sum of one elementwidth and one interelement width) as small as 2% with 75% accuracy whether active or passive touch is used (Lamb, 1983).\nSurface Roughness\nMuch of the research on tactile texture perception has focused speci \ufb01cally on the highly prominent perceptual dimension of roughness. Note\nthat we have chosen to discuss this topic most extensively under the category of tactile sensing (cf. active haptic sensing) inasmuch as research\nindicates that the perception of roughness is similar under both conditions provided there is relative motion between the skin and the surface(Lamb, 1983; Lederman, 1981, 1983; Verrillo, Bolanowski, & McGlone, 1999). This suggests that cutaneous (as opposed to haptic, which\nincludes both cutaneous and kinesthetic) inputs primarily determine perceived roughness.\nIn addition to considering the effect of mode of touch (tactile versus active haptic sensing), researchers have also evaluated the contribution of\na number of parameters that pertain to surface microgeometry (e.g., dot width, interelement spacing, spatial period, ratio of element width togap62 Tactile Sensing", "doc_id": "05e086c1-708a-4e96-952d-dc1cc2fa335d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0d10ada6fbd5b99ae536cc90faf28ed5c4d3ac18ee2d8ced385cd4f6909b7785", "extra_info": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2317}, "relationships": {"1": "e1e87e3a-2c82-4429-9ca6-85940a361413"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "56639e26-8586-4af2-afe5-95e292dde58f": {"__data__": {"text": "width) and to the manner in which the surfaces contact the skin (force, relative speed). The magnitude estimation procedure has often been\nused to examine the rate at which the magnitude of perceived roughness grows as a function of the physicalparameters of the textured\nsurfaces and presentation parameters. Many different types of surface textures have been evaluated, including, for example, one-dimensionalgratings (Lederman, 1974), two-dimensional dot patterns (Connor & Johnson, 1992), and abrasive surfaces (Hollins & Risner, 2000; Stevens &Harris, 1962).\nEarly work with incised one-dimensional rectangular gratings ( \ufb01gure 4.14A) suggested that the criticaldeterminants of perceived roughness are\nthe interelement spacing of incised rectangular gratings (G) and applied force (F), as shown in \ufb01gure 4.14B. Perceived roughness grows as\nsome function of G\n*F\u00bc(Taylor & Lederman, 1975). When not experimentally confounded with groove width, however, spatial period has no\neffect on perceived roughness (Lederman, 1983). In addition, the speed of relative motion demonstrates little effect with active exploration of\none-dimensionalgratings (Lederman, 1983) or with passive touch of two-dimensionalraised-dot patterns (Meftah, Bel ingard, & Chapman,2000). In another study, adapting the \ufb01ngertip selectively to either a 40 dBSL low-frequency (20 Hz) or 40 dBSL high-frequency (250 Hz)\nvibration was initially shown to reduce the perceived magnitudes of a set of vibrations varying in intensity, provided the stimulus frequency wasthe same as that used during the adaptation period. Nevertheless, the same selective-adaptation procedures subsequently failed to in \ufb02uence the\nperceived roughness magnitudes of stimulus gratings (Lederman, Loomis, & Williams, 1982). On the basis of these three sets of converging\nresults, vibration (and, therefore, temporal factors) appears to play no role in tactile roughness perception. Based on these psychophysical\nresults, Taylor and Lederman (1975) proposed a quasi-static model of roughness perception in terms of the mechanical parameters of skin\ndeformation. The modelsuggests that human roughness perception is encoded intensivel y, based on the vol umetric deviation of skin\ndeformed from its resting position during contact with the gratings. Note that while a spatial interpretation of those results is also possible,predictions based on the use of spatialversus intensive codes coul d not be disambiguated by this earl y work with one-dimensionalgratings. Todo so at the time would have required the technological capacity to produce sets of gratings that equated overall skin deformation whilevarying the spatial pattern. Spatial coding would predict perceptual equivalence in contrast to intensive coding, which would predict perceptualdifferentiation. For current purposes, we will not differentiate between the two forms of coding and therefore describe the model as spatial-intensive.\nHuman psychophysical experiments with two-dimensional raised-dot patterns suggest that observers also use a spatial-intensive (as opposed\nto a temporal) code to judge the magnitude of perceived roughness of dot patterns with centers separated by 1.3 \u20136.2 mm (Blake, Hsiao, &\nJohnson, 1997; Blake, Johnson, & Hsiao, 1997; Connor, Hsiao, Phillips, & Johnson, 1990; Connor & Johnson, 1992). Complementary\nneurophysiological work with monkeys strongly implicates peripheral SA I tactile units (as opposed to FA I or FA II) in the encoding of\nstimulus roughness. Johnson and his colleagues propose that perceived roughness is represented in terms of a spatial-intensive neural code inwhich the spatialdot patterns are encoded as l ocalspatialvariations in the \ufb01ring rates of adjacent SA I tactile units with receptive \ufb01eld centers\nseparated by about 2 mm", "doc_id": "56639e26-8586-4af2-afe5-95e292dde58f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5ab2b208f99cde16c930147eed3a6fb819305482e9e1feab65d22d0504a8f064", "extra_info": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3792}, "relationships": {"1": "37420335-b9ee-4054-b642-29f672eecf4f", "3": "d2e5abcc-9fd3-4ee3-91f0-c2a2bc8f450d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2e5abcc-9fd3-4ee3-91f0-c2a2bc8f450d": {"__data__": {"text": "code to judge the magnitude of perceived roughness of dot patterns with centers separated by 1.3 \u20136.2 mm (Blake, Hsiao, &\nJohnson, 1997; Blake, Johnson, & Hsiao, 1997; Connor, Hsiao, Phillips, & Johnson, 1990; Connor & Johnson, 1992).

According to this neural model, local spatial variation is computed in cortical area S-I (i.e., area 3b) and thensummated in secondary somatic cortex (S-II) to produce an intensive code for perceived roughness (Hsiao, Johnson, & Twombly , 1993).\nSubsequent work by this group proposed that activity in SA I units can also account for human roughness perception of two-dimensional dot\npatterns with interelement spacings \ufb01ner than SA I receptor spacings (Yoshioka, Gibb, Dorsch, Hsiao, & Johnson, 2001).

Connor et al. (1990) obtained an inverted-U shape when perceived roughness was plotted as a function of center-to-center dot\nspacing or spatial period (ranging from 1.3 to 6.2 mm, peaking at about 3.2 mm); however, Meftah et al. (2000) have documented a linear\nfunction over spatialperiods ranging from 1.5 to 8.5 mm. The discrepancy is shown in \ufb01gure 4.15 (panels A and B, respectively). Moreover,\nLederman and her colleagues have consistently noted in the laboratory that when using their bare \ufb01ngers, observers are reluctant to make\njudgments of roughness of two-dimensionalraised-dot patterns with spatialperiods more than about 3.5 mm. The reasons for such strikingdiscrepancies need to be resolved if we are to understand fully the basic psychophysics of roughness perception and to apply the results of thisbasic research successfully to domains that involve the perception of surface roughness by touch.\nUp to this point in the discussion, we have considered single-code models of roughness perception mediated by the population of SA I units.\nHowever, Hollins and his colleagues (e.g., Hollins et al., 1998; Hollins, Bensmaia, & Washburn, 2001; Hollins & Risner, 2000) have proposed a\nduplex model of tactile roughness perception that differentiates between the perceptions of \ufb01ne versus coarse textures. More speci \ufb01cally, small\nvibrations underlie the perception of very \ufb01ne surfaces that are too \ufb01ne to be resolved by any mechanoreceptor population, whereas a single\nspatial-intensive code underlies the perception of more coarse surfaces, as proposed earlier by Lederman, Johnson, and their respectivecolleagues. Results obtained by Hollins et al. (2001) reveal that adapting both RA and PC channels with a high-intensity adapting stimulus of100 Hz produces poorer discrimination of very \ufb01ne textures compared to an unadapted controlcondition. In contrast, there is no difference\nbetween the two conditions when coarse textures are discriminated. Such results support the proposal that \ufb01ne texture perception is indeed\nmediated by vibration, whereas coarse texture perception is not. An experiment by Hollins et al. (2001) con \ufb01rmed that when the RA and PC\nchannels are selectively adapted to high-intensity 10 Hz and 250 Hz vibrations, respectively , \ufb01ne texture discrimination is abolished when the\n250 Hz, but not the 10 Hz, adapting stimulus is used, suggesting that perception of very \ufb01ne textures is mediated by the PC channel.

In the former study, observers were required to provide magnitude\nestimates of the perceived roughness of periodic gratings, which varied in ridge or groove width, when scanned across the \ufb01nger at different\ncontrolled forces and speeds. Along with the gratings' spatial frequency, variations in speed would therefore contribute to temporal frequencycues. A second task in the Cascio and Sathian study involved roughness discrimination in which temporal frequency was either held constantor exaggerated. In keeping with previous results, those of the current study con \ufb01rmed a strong effect of groove width; however, a relatively\nsmall effect for temporal frequency for ridge-varying gratings was also found, thereby implying a small role for temporal coding in theperception of coarse roughness as well.\nFinally, we should address the role of friction in judgments of roughness magnitude. An early study by Taylor and Lederman (1975) found no\neffects for a set of incised metalgratings varying in groove width from 0.125 to 1 mm (constant ridge width of 0.25 mm) when the surfaceswere either dry or lubricated with detergent. However, a subsequent investigation by Smith et al. (2002) used raised columns of two-dimensionalpatterns of truncated cones with l ongitudinalspatialperiods ranging in the transverse direction from 1.5 to 8.5 mm (dot diameterof 0.6 mm along the top, 1.0 mm along the base; corresponding interelement spacing values ranged from 0.9 to 7.9 mm and from 0.5 to 7.5mm). Both normaland tangentialforces were recorded throughout the active stroking interval . In the \ufb01rst experiment, perceived roughness\ncorrelated well with the mean normalized root mean square of the tangential force rate. In a second experiment, the changes in tangential force\nwere dissociated from the surface geometry and the mean kinetic friction by requiring observers to estimate the roughness of dry versus\nlubricated surfaces. The results revealed that the mean normalized root mean square of the tangential force rate changed by approximately\n21% and the subjective estimates of roughness by about 16%. The collective results from the two experiments suggest that the root meansquare of the rate of change in tangentialforce may al so contribute to perceived roughness magnitude.\nCompliance\nIn judging object compliance, both cutaneous and kinesthetic cues are potentially available. People apparently use cutaneous inputs to the\ufb01ngertip during both tactile and active haptic sensing to judge the softness of deformable elastic objects made of silicone rubber. In a\npsychophysicalstudy that invol ved both rank-order and discrimination tasks, Srinivasan and LaMotte (1995) presented such objects to the\nobserver's passive \ufb01ngerpad so that the sensory information would be restricted to cutaneous inputs. Cutaneous information alone proved\nsuf\ufb01cient for discriminating the rubber surfaces. Presumably, because the contact force was constant, the spatial distribution of pressure within\nthe contact region on the \ufb01ngertip could be used to differentiate objects in terms of their relative compliance. Additional supporting data were\nobtained in another experiment in which observers used active haptic sensing while the \ufb01ngertip was anesthetized, a procedure used to\neliminate the cutaneous inputs. In keeping with the earlier passive-touch experiment, observers with the \ufb01nger anesthetized were unable to\ndiscriminate even very large differences in compliance.

In this study, observers were required to choose the colder of two materials presented to the tips of the index \ufb01ngers.

In this experiment, observers were required to identify whichof three materials presented to the \ufb01ngertips differed from the other two. This task was considerably more dif \ufb01cult than the \ufb01rst\ndiscrimination experiment, as the overall correct response rate averaged 57%, as compared to 90% in experiment 1. It would be intriguing todetermine whether the underlying thermal cue for material variations is referred to adjacent \ufb01ngers, as Green (1977) reported. Although the\nquestion is intriguing, the Ho and Jones experiment used a different experimental task (i.e., localization) and smaller thermal differences across\nthe\ufb01ngers, making it somewhat dif \ufb01cult to make comparisons between the two studies.\nThese studies indicate that thermalcues can be used to recognize objects by touch, but as the resting temperature of the skin is typical l y higher\nthan the ambient temperature of objects encountered in the environment, the thermalconductance and heat capacity of different material s are\nused to assist in identifying what the object is made from. The absolute temperature is not informative because at room temperature it isusually the same for each object palpated. The coding of object temperature is therefore primarily determined by the activity of cold receptors,which signalthe cool ing of the skin.\nWeight\nWeight is perceived less effectively when the object rests on a stationary hand that is supported by a rigid surface (i.e., tactile sensing) than\nwhen it is lifted (i.e., active haptic sensing). For example, when Brodie and Ross (1984) required their observers to judge weight via tactile\nsensing, the Weber fraction (i.e., difference threshold/intensity of the standard) averaged 0.13 for a 54 g standard. This value was 1.46 timeslarger than that obtained via active haptic sensing. When tactile sensing alone is used, weight judgments are based solely upon cutaneous\ninputs. Under such circumstances, neither kinesthetic feedback nor corollary discharges from the efferent commands are available.\nFigure 4.16.

The cold weights felt substantially heavier than the neutral weights at all body sites. Warm weights alsotended to intensify heaviness sensations, but the results were only statistically signi \ufb01cant on the palm, forearm, and upper arm. These results\nmay be interpreted based on an earlier proposal offered by J. C. Stevens and Green (1978), namely, that thermal intensi \ufb01cation of perceived\nheaviness is due to the failure of mechanoreceptors to respond selectively to mechanical stimulation. Several classes of mechanoreceptors aretemperature sensitive, and hence their responses will change with variations in temperature. The results are more dif \ufb01cult to explain in terms\nof an additive cognitive model, which proposes that sensations of temperature, which are to be ignored, summate with weight to yield a\nstronger impression of weight. Unlike cold, which consistently magni \ufb01es weight perception, warmth intensi \ufb01es perceived weight only in some\nregions of the body. Hence, the validity of such a cognitive interpretation seems less likely.\nMaterial\nAs noted above, in principle, objects that vary in material may be identi \ufb01ed and discriminated on the bases of their texture, compliance, and\nthermal conductivity, either singly or in some combination depending on the relative effectiveness of the cues available at the time.\nGeometric Properties\nOrientation\nWhen line orientations are presented to the distal portion of the \ufb01ngertip, observers can reliably discriminate changes in orientation better\nwhen the standard stimulus is oriented horizontally or vertically as opposed to obliquely (e.g., at 45 \u00b0), as shown in \ufb01gure 4.17 (Lechelt, 1988).\nKnown as the oblique\nFigure 4.17.

For a circle or sphere,curvature is inversely related to the radius of curvature. For ease of interpretation, the following discussion describes stimuli primarily in term s\nof their radius of curvature with corresponding curvature values added in parentheses. Based on tactile sensing via the \ufb01nger, observers can\ndiscriminate a decrease in the radius of curvature (or increase in curvature) of spherically curved segments of approximately 13% and 18% forcorresponding standards of 3.5 mm (0.29 mm\n-1) and 6.5 mm (0.15 mm-1) (Goodwin & Wheat, 1992). A forced-choice paradigm was used in\nthis work in which observers were required to judge whether a pair of stimuli were the same or different.

These correspond to detecting a curvature change of \u02dc10%. Applied contact forces of 0.20, 0.39,\nand 0.59 N all generated monotonically increasing estimates of the amount of curvature as a function of the decreasing radius of curvature.The radius of curvature extended across a fairly natural set of values from 1.44 mm (0.69 mm\n-1) to a perfectly \ufb02at surface (Goodwin, John, &\nMarceglia, 1991). Overall, force has a variable effect on perceived curvature, as compared to the highly consistent effect due to changes inphysical curvature. Finally, we note that curvature discrimination of strips presented statically to the hand is best when placed along as opposedto perpendicular to the \ufb01ngers (Pont, Kappers, & Koenderink, 1998). When presented in the former orientation, observers can discriminate\nthe curvature of a stimulus with a radius of curvature of 2500 mm (curvature = 0.0004 mm\n-1) from one that is \ufb02at.\nIn experiments that examine microgeometry, information pertaining to an object's shape and size is contained in the population responses of\nSA I and FA I mechanoreceptors (LaMotte & Srinivasan, 1987a, 1987b; Srinivasan & LaMotte, 1987). In this series of studies, different shapes(e.g., sinusoidal steps, cylindrical bars) were applied both statically and via passive stroking to the stationary \ufb01ngertips of monkeys.

To date, we know of no studies that have speci \ufb01cally tested for the horizontal-vertical illusion by\npassively drawing patterns on the hand, but it would be interesting to know whether there is an illusion, and if so, how it changes relative to the\norientation of the hand (for the perceptualeffects of hand orientation, see the next section, \u201cRaised Two-DimensionalPatterns \u201d).\nRaised Two-Dimensional Patterns\nObservers use both cutaneous feedback from the \ufb01ngers and kinesthetic feedback from the arm to maximize the discrimination of large two-\ndimensional shapes that vary in angle (Voisin, Lamarre, & Chapman, 2002). However, given the clear involvement of the kinesthetic system as\nwell, we will consider this study more fully in the corresponding section in chapter 5.\nThe remaining discussion relates almost exclusively to the tactile recognition of \ufb01ngertip-sized patterns, which are processed solely by the\ncutaneous system. Provided that tactile sensing involves relative motion between the skin and such stimuli, observers are capable of relatively\nquickly recognizing geometric patterns, such as Braille, geometric forms, and Roman letters (Craig, 1981; Loomis, 1981a). Johnson and hisassociates (Johnson & Phillips, 1981; Phillips, Johansson, & Johnson, 1990) have suggested that SA I tactile units serve as the primary neuralperipheral mechanism in such tasks because of their relatively small receptive \ufb01elds, although they do not rule out a subsidiary role for the FA\nI units with their slightly larger receptive \ufb01elds. The work of this group of researchers has led them to argue that pattern recognition via tactile\nsensing is solely limited peripherally by the spacing of the SA I units.\nMost of the research on tactile pattern recognition has focused on fundamental issues pertaining to the nature of the underlying processes and\nspatial representations, as opposed to issues pertaining to character legibility. For example, Loomis (1981b, 1982) demonstrated strongsimilarity between tactile ( \ufb01ngertip) and visual legibility of character sets differing in size and typography (e.g., Roman letters, Braille characters,\netc.) when visualacuity was matched to tactil e acuity via opticalbl urring ( \ufb01gure 4.19). During the practice phase, observers initially learned the\nnames of the characters belonging to a given set; in a subsequent recognition phase, they alternated between visual and tactile modes ofexamination. With the exception of a few systematic differences, Loomis subsequently (1982) noted marked similarities between the confusionmatrices for letters and Braille characters. The procedure was similar to that used in his 1981 study. Collectively , Loomis's results furthercon\ufb01rm that tactile pattern recognition is spatially limited only by the spatial resolution of the cutaneous system, as determined by the spacing\nof the peripheral SA I mechanoreceptors (see also Johnson & Phillips, 1981; Phillips, Johansson, & Johnson, 1990). Loomis's empirical studies\nculminated in a quantitative process model of pattern recognition by touch or blurred vision, which was designed to explain differences inlegibility across character sets and to predict errors in the confusion matrix for an arbitrary set of patterns (Loomis, 1990). The modelproposes that pattern recognition is the result of a two-stage process. In stage 1, an internal representation of the character is formed. Thestimulus is processed through a linear, low-pass spatial \ufb01lter, followed by nonlinear compression of stimulus intensity. In stage 2, the internal\nrepresentation is matched to each stored representation contained in the character set. Response selection is based on Luce's (1963) unbiasedchoice model.

Craig has investigated\nthe contribution of a number of factors to tactile pattern recognition. He used the tactile display from the Optacon ( \ufb01gure 4.10) to generate\nalphabetic patterns from an array of vibrating pins (6 \u00d724) with a computer substituting for the camera.

Performance did not change\nmeaningfully beyond 50 ms in the static mode nor beyond 400 ms in the scanned mode. These results highlight the need to consider both themode of presentation and the stimulus duration with respect to single-letter recognition performance. Performance in the static mode was alsoconsiderably enhanced when the amplitude of the signal was increased, although this was not the case in the scanned mode.\nAs letters are not normally read in isolation, Craig also examined the extent to which patterns occurring relatively close in time to the target\nletter might interfere with letter recognition. Static and scanned modes were similarly affected by the relative timing between the letter stimulusand a masker created by activating all of the pins in the top 18 rows across all 6 columns. The end of the masker was separated in time from\nthe onset of the letter (interstimulus interval) by a range extending from 8 ms (no masking stimulus present) through 0 ms (forward masking)\nand from 0 through to 250 ms (backward masking). Backward masking, in which the masker follows the letter, proved more deleterious thanforward masking, in which the masker precedes the target letter ( \ufb01gure 4.20).\nCraig (1982a) subsequently identi \ufb01ed the type of masker as being important as well. He compared performance with pattern versus energy\nmasks under severalconditions (forward versus backward masking at severall evel s of intensity). Craig created the pattern masks by dividingthe display space into equal segments, then randomly assigning one letter fragment (e.g., vertical line, curved line, etc.) to each segment. Incontrast, an energy mask consisted of turning on all pins in the vicinity of the target letter. The overall results indicated that pattern maskersinterfered with tactile letter recognition more than energy masks. Craig (1982b) also con \ufb01rmed the importance of temporalintegration (i.e., the\ntime course over which temporally separated patterns can be integrated), using several different procedures. Collectively , the results suggest\nthat the cutaneous system can totally integrate the pattern over a period lasting less than 10 ms and that the accuracy of tactile letterrecognition asymptotes at about 50 ms. For more detailed interpretation of these results, the reader should consult Craig (1983a, 1983b) andLoomis and Lederman (1986).\nThus far, we have focused on how the spatialand temporalprocessing characteristics of the cutaneous system restrict tactil e pattern\nperception and recognition. Another criticalconsideration is the spatialdirection of the stimul ated skin surface rel ative to the body and to theexternal environment. Some of the relevant research has involved drawing bidimensionally asymmetric patterns (e.g., the number 2, the letter\nL) on different body surfaces (e.g., forehead, back of head, palm) of a stationary observer.

The samedifferences in pattern perception occur when the corresponding patterns are drawn on the back of a backward-facing hand and the forward-facing palm, respectively. However, when traced on the backward-facing palm with the elbow bent, the percept corresponds to a normallyoriented 2; in contrast, when the palm is rotated away from the body with the thumb pointing upward, a reversed 2 is perceived ( \ufb01gure 4.21).\nNote that in this second example, the percept changes despite an unchanging pattern of cutaneous stimulation. Thus, the observer must be\nprocessing the cutaneous information within some allocentric (i.e., external) frame of reference. Based on a number of informal observations,\nCorcoran proposed that observers view these patterns as if they were drawn on a transparent body via a \u201cdisembodied eye \u201dpositioned behind\nand a little above the observer.\nOther researchers have obtained similar results (e.g., Krech & Crutch \ufb01eld, 1958; Natsoulas, 1966).

Their experiments further revealed that with respect to three-dimensional\nhaptic space, observers make judgments with respect to the \u201cabove\u201d/\u201cbelow\u201daxis in allocentric terms, with respect to the \u201cnear\u201d/\u201cfar\u201daxis in\negocentric terms (i.e., with reference to the observer), and with respect to the left/right axis in terms of a combination of allocentric and\negocentric factors. Old \ufb01eld and Phillips argued further that when haptically judging form, observers could take hand position into account\nwith respect to the three-dimensional spatial framework that was selected. The data do not support the possibility that, at least in this task,perceivers converted their haptically derived representations into visually mediated representations.\nParsons and Shimojo (1987) performed a more comprehensive analysis of the perception of bidimensionally asymmetric patterns (normal\nversus mirror-reversed letters and numbers) traced on a large number of body sites. The results are complex and thus dif \ufb01cult to summarize\nsuccinctly. Observers were instructed to identify each pattern and its orientation based on initial impressions. The investigators began byshowing that perception was in \ufb02uenced by the speci \ufb01c surface that was stimulated (e.g., forehead, tongue, hand). A second experiment\nclari\ufb01ed those results by showing that perception is affected not by the speci \ufb01c body site per se, but rather by the position (e.g., palm, back of\nhand) and orientation (e.g., forward, downward, etc.) of the stimulated body surface. A third experiment revealed that stimuli traced on thefront and back of the head are judged with respect to local frames of reference located behind those surfaces: the frame tops match the top ofthe head, and the frame fronts are oriented opposite to the front of the head. In contrast, stimuli traced on surfaces other than the head are\njudged neither strictly within a local or whole-body frame of reference nor with respect to the frames used for the front and back of the head.\nRather, the frames that are chosen appear to rely in a complex manner on the whole body and are selected on the basis of the position and\norientation of the stimulated surface.

In the current chapter we will also discuss a number of additional tasks that speci \ufb01cally\nrely on the use of combined tactile and kinesthetic inputs.\nIt is important to emphasize that active haptic sensing per se constitutes a legitimate form of multimodal perception inasmuch as this form of\nsensing uses both tactile and kinesthetic sensory inputs. It is critical that we understand how the haptic system functions in concert with other\nmodalities, such as vision and audition; however, the details of such a complex topic lie well beyond the scope of this book. The interested\nreader should consult Welch and Warren (1986) and Calvert et al. (2004). Here, we provide a relatively limited discussion of multisensoryprocessing with respect to selected topics for which there exists a substantial body of research.\nRole of Hand Movements\nIt has been proposed that active manual exploration plays a critical role in the normal development of somatosensory perception in mammals\n(Bushnell & Boudreau, 1991; Nicolelis, de Oliveira, Lin, & Chapin, 1996). However, for \ufb01ngertip-sized stimuli (e.g., textures, Braille\ncharacters), provided there is relative motion between skin and surface, it matters relatively little whether the hand moves over a stationary\nsurface or the surface moves across the stationary hand (Grunwald, 1965; Lamb, 1983; Lederman, 1981; Vega-Bermudez, Johnson, & Hsiao,\n1991).\nPeople normally choose to execute different stereotypical hand-movement patterns when they manually explore an object to learn about a\nspeci\ufb01c property. Lederman and Klatzky (1987) have documented a number of such movement patterns, or exploratory procedures (EPs).\nTheir observers were initially presented with a standard object that could be described in terms of different attributes, such as texture, weight,or shape. On any trial, they were instructed to explore the standard object to learn about a designated attribute (i.e., texture, hardness, thermal\nproperties, weight, coarse shape, \ufb01ne shape, volume, motion of a part, or object function). Observers were then presented in turn with three\ncomparison objects, each of which also varied in terms of a number of physical attributes. They were asked to choose the comparison objectthat best matched the standard in terms of the previously named attribute. The hand movements were videotaped and subsequently analyzed.Observers systematically chose to apply a speci \ufb01c EP, depending on the attribute they were instructed to explore. For example, they typically\nmoved their hands in a repetitive, back-and-forth manner across the surface (lateral motion EP) when extracting information about surfacetexture. In contrast, when judging the weight of an object, they lifted the object away from a supporting surface. Figure 5.1 shows the six EPsthat have received the most research attention, together with the object property or properties for which each has been shown to be optimal.Two additional EPs initially documented include the part-motion test (i.e., testing for motion of an object part) and the function test (i.e.,\ntesting for an object's function, as suggested by its structure). In a second experiment, the same match-to-sample task was used, only this time\nobservers were constrained to perform each of the six EPs shown in \ufb01gure 5.1 in conjunction with each of seven property-matching tasks.\nResponse accuracy was used to order the EPs with respect to each property, with \u201cties\u201dbeing broken in terms of associated response times.\nThe results highlight the relative differences in EP precision. That is, for each property, one EP is optimal and, in the case of \ufb01ne shape,\nnecessary, as opposed to being merely suf \ufb01cient or insuf \ufb01cient to perform the task (i.e., chance level).

For example, lateral\nmotion and pressure EPs are relatively less general because they provide only three different types of object information (i.e., texture, hardness,\nand thermal properties). In contrast, both enclosure and contour following EPs are more general in that they provide some information about\nalmost all of the attributes that have been studied. Finally, the EPs differ in terms of mean duration or execution time. The relative precision,\ngenerality, and duration of the six EPs are presented in \ufb01gure 5.2.

Across a set of haptic search tasks that targeted different object dimensions, Lederman and Klatzky (1997)\nshowed that observers could process coarse differences in dimensions (e.g., rough/smooth, hard/soft, warm/cool) and the absence/presenceof an edge relatively quickly and in parallel across the \ufb01ngers of both hands, regardless of the number of \ufb01ngers stimulated. In contrast, they\nprocessed geometric dimensions (e.g., relative position, relative orientation) more slowly and in sequence across the stimulated \ufb01ngers of both\nhands. Lederman and Klatzky concluded that following an initial brief contact, information about material properties and edges is available forfurther haptic processing earlier than is geometric information.\nThe differences in relative EP ef \ufb01ciency (as measured by accuracy and speed) led to the prediction that variations along material dimensions\nthat are perceptually equivalent to those along geometric dimensions will be more cognitively salient to the haptic observer.

Physical values on each dimension were chosen on the basis of prior psychophysical testing to\nensure that the objects could be differentiated within any of the four dimensions in perceptually equivalent ways. Different groups of observers\nwere given different modality-biasing instructions, designed to favor visual versus haptic processing or vice versa. Based on previous \ufb01ndings\nregarding how ef \ufb01ciently each modality processes material versus geometric inputs, it was predicted and con \ufb01rmed that when biased toward\nprocessing the objects visually, observers would weight the geometric properties, most notably shape, more strongly than the materialproperties in their similarity judgments. Conversely , when they were biased toward processing the objects haptically, they would weight thevariation of material properties (texture and compliance) more strongly than the variation of geometric properties. Similar results wereobtained when the objects differed in material (i.e., thermal and weight cues for wood versus aluminum), shape, and size (Lederman et al.,1996), as shown in \ufb01gure 5.3.

Blindfolded observerswere able to recognize 100 common objects with a very high degree of success (regardless of the accuracy criterion adopted, i.e., stringent orlax) and very quickly (i.e., typically within only 2 \u20133 seconds).

Stage 1 consists of some combination of two EPs that are both relatively fast and general, that is, the grasp (enclosure EP) and lift(unsupported holding EP) (Lederman & Klatzky, 1990). Together, these broadly suf \ufb01cient EPs provide coarse information about many\ndifferent object dimensions. Stage 1 is performed regardless of which property is most diagnostic of the named object class. Manualexploration during stage 2 follows stage 1 and is optional. When it is performed, observers implement the EP(s) that provide(s) the mostprecise information about the property which is most diagnostic of the named class of objects.\nOne important issue with respect to object recognition concerns whether or not haptically derived object representations are view\nindependent. Newell, Ernst, Tjan, and Bulthoff (2001) addressed this issue by initially allowing observers to explore visually or haptically\nunfamiliar three-dimensional objects constructed from Lego blocks that were attached to a table. Next, they were tested with an enlarged set ofobjects that included both new and old ones. Using either the same or another modality, observers were asked to indicate whether or not eachobject had been previously examined. Objects were presented in the same orientation during initial learning and subsequent test phases (0 \u00b0), or\nthey were rotated 180 \u00b0about the X, Y, or Z axes during the test phase. Unimodalperformance worsened whil e cross-modalperformance\nimproved when objects were rotated 180 \u00b0about both the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes between learning and test phases. Apparently,\npeople recognize objects visually best from the front; in contrast, they haptically recognize objects best from the back, indicating that haptic\nand visualobject representations are both view speci \ufb01c, but in strikingly different ways. Such a result further implies the need for some type of\ntranslation process. The cross-modal data also indicate that such intersensory processing can be relatively ef \ufb01cient.\nA second important issue pertains to the effect on haptic object recognition of constraining manualexpl oration. As this topic rel ates most\ndirectly to end effectors, we will reserve that discussion until chapter 8.\nRecognition of Two-Dimensional Raised-Outline Drawings of Com-\nmon Objects\nOther research has focused on the recognition of two-dimensional raised-outline drawings of common objects by sighted, blindfolded\nobservers and by those with visual impairments. When exploration is free, performance by adults and children with such tangible displays isconsiderably poorer than with real common objects, although it has been well above chance in some cases (D'Angiulli, Kennedy, & Heller,\n1988; Lederman, Klatzky, Chataway, & Summers, 1990; Magee & Kennedy, 1980). The relatively poor performance typically observed is not\nsurprising given that these displays are usually limited to raised two-dimensional contours (i.e., there is no change in three-dimensional shape\nand little, if any, change in material properties). High demands on spatiotemporal integration and memory impose considerable constraints onprocessing raised-line pictures effectively (Loomis et al., 1991). We note that when manual exploration is guided by the experimenter,performance improves somewhat. Presumably by eliminating the need to establish and maintain contact with the contours in the display,observers are then freer to focus their attention on perceiving the nature of the two-dimensional pattern (Richardson & Wuillemin, 1981).\nThere is evidence that blind people with some previous vision form a visual image of the haptically derived information and use it for\npurposes of recognition (Heller, 1989; Lederman et", "doc_id": "3db410ac-c7cc-4eb3-984f-89cb436faf06", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "93b9fc661e020388f0269ea9543ba332b0a5529f1f0119b0824be3f8d8f5d085", "extra_info": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4007}, "relationships": {"1": "a80968bf-770e-4948-ad8d-a45ea250fc4b", "3": "fc4340b2-f8cb-495e-91c4-60b2660c6058"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc4340b2-f8cb-495e-91c4-60b2660c6058": {"__data__": {"text": "these displays are usually limited to raised two-dimensional contours (i.e., there is no change in three-dimensional shape\nand little, if any, change in material properties).

This implies that cutaneous\nmechanoreceptors provide the primary source of information for roughness perception. The reader should therefore consult thecorresponding section in chapter 4 for a comprehensive discussion of texture perception by touch.\nCompliance\nUnlike the relatively extensive study of tactile texture perception, there has been little investigation of important material properties related to\ncompliance or other attributes, such as elasticity and viscosity. In 1937, David Katz published a fascinating article on the psychological\njudgments of different physicalproperties of dough by expert bakers. Katz argued that such a psychophysicalstudy was important inasmuchas many of the bakers' complaints regarding the quality of a \ufb02our were based on their subjective impressions when making the dough. Katz\nproposed that if one goes beyond the subjective terminology adopted by the bakers, the experts are in fact evaluating four primary physicalaspects of dough, namely, stickiness, elasticity, \ufb01rmness or toughness, and extensibility (i.e., how much a batch of dough may be stretched\nbefore it breaks). He summarized the overall results of the various coarse psychophysical tests he conducted using a series of doughs that weremade by varying the amounts of two different \ufb02ours mixed together to produce a just noticeable change in the dough's properties. In brief,\nKatz noted that the bakers were most sensitive to changes in stickiness, a perceptualproperty that was described as very unpl easant. In\naddition, he concluded that the bakers were relatively insensitive to variations in elasticity and viscosity. Katz's conclusions are intriguing an d\nworth extending beyond the application domain from which they emerged. Future investigations will be able to employ the more precisemethods of experimentation and stimulus control that are currently available.\nWhen observers judge the stiffness (inverse of compliance) of springs enclosed in cylinders with rigid surfaces, a Weber fraction of about 17%\nis obtained. (The Weber fraction is equalto the difference threshol d expressed as a percentage of the standard intensity.) Skin anesthesia andjoint anesthesia have no effect on stiffness thresholds (Roland & Ladegaard-Pedersen, 1977), suggesting that cutaneous inputs do not play arole. Other studies have obtained Weber fractions with active touch that range from 8% to 22% depending on the cues available in theparticular task. When terminal force cues are present, observers can use them to perform the task without actually having to discriminate on\nthe basis of compliance (Tan, Durlach, Beauregard, & Srinivasan, 1995). However, discrimination based explicitly on compliance requires the\nuse of both force and displacement. In the Tan et al. (1995) study, subjects grasped two plates between their thumbs and index \ufb01ngers,\nsqueezing them together along a linear track. Additional results support the fact that on their own, cutaneous cues are not suf \ufb01cient for\ndifferentiating the stiffness of compliant objects with planar rigid surfaces; rather, both tactile and kinesthetic cues are necessary (Srinivasa n&\nLaMotte, 1995).

However, there is no reason to expect any differences.\nMaterial Composition\nAlthough experimental details are somewhat sparse, Katz (1925/1989) has addressed the perception and recognition of object material per seusing active touch. In one experiment, he reported that observers could distinguish between 13 pairs of different kinds of paper surfaces (e.g.,writing papers, blotting papers, drawing papers, etc.) quite well. In other experiments, he used a wider range of materials and required\nobservers to recognize each material (e.g., wood, metal, plastic, glass, fabric, etc.).

Nevertheless, Katz makes some valuable observations related to the manner of touching and\nto the differentialavail abil ity of severalsensory cues to materialidenti \ufb01cation. For example, as noted subsequently (Lederman & Klatzky,\n1987), tapping actively with the \ufb01nger (pressure EP) provides good tactile cues to compliance (e.g., vibration, net force, spatially distributed\nforce pro \ufb01le). Statically contacting the surfaces (static contact EP) provides only coarse information about the differences in the thermal\ncharacteristics of the different materials.

Visual cues and touch-produced sounds are also available to identify and differentiate\nmaterials.\nOther investigators have also evaluated material identi \ufb01cation. For example, Wynn Parry and Salter (1976) required a group of 40 observers to\nidentify 10 different stimulus materials by name. The materials were sheepskin, leather (suede), silk, canvas, rubber, plastic, wool, cotton,\ncarpet, and sandpaper. The average recognition time decreased from 5 s for sheepskin to 2 s for sandpaper. Robertson and Jones (1994)required their participants to match a 10 \u00d710 mm square of materialto one of three sampl es. The material s were the same as those used by\nWynn Parry and Salter. The average scores were excellent, 9.8 out of 10 (SD = 0.58) for both the left and right hands.\nWeight\nWeight is best judged by actively lifting an object away from a supporting surface, thus making available information provided by cutaneousand kinesthetic receptors and by neural correlates of the descending motor commands (also known as efferent copies or corollary discharges;L. A. Jones, 1986). The difference threshold for weight discrimination by lifting objects is 8%. Dynamically hefting or jiggling them furtherimproves performance to 6% (Brodie & Ross, 1985).\nResearchers have demonstrated that observers use more than object mass to assess apparent weight. Haptic weight perception is strongly\nin\ufb02uenced by the object's size, which is a geometric property. This distortion of weight perception is known as the size-weight illusion: A large\nand small object of the same mass do not appear to be equally heavy; rather, the large object is judged to be lighter than the small one\n(Charpentier, 1891). The classic form of this illusion involves both visual and haptic inputs, that is, observers heft the object while looking at it.\nHowever, Ellis and Lederman (1993) have con \ufb01rmed the existence of a purely haptic version of the illusion. Their observers were required to\nprovide magnitude estimates of the heaviness of cubes that were equalin mass but different in vol ume under varying size-expl orationconditions, as shown in \ufb01gure 5.6A. The results con \ufb01rmed that unimodalhaptic cues are both suf \ufb01cient and necessary to obtain a full-strength\nbimodal (vision and haptics) size-weight illusion. In contrast, unimodal visual cues are merely suf \ufb01cient, and they produce only a moderate\nsize-weight illusion. Kawai (2002a, 2002b) has since provided empirical evidence that the haptic size-weight illusion re \ufb02ects a speci \ufb01c instance\nof heaviness (and lightness) discrimination. Normally, this involves integrating weight and density inputs, with density in turn determined bydividing the weight by the haptically perceived size. In the case of the size-weight illusion, however, perceived heaviness is distorted because\nthe cues to size and weight con \ufb02ict.\nHaptic weight perception is also in \ufb02uenced by object material, although less than previously noted with object size. Objects having the same\nmass but different material coverings (e.g., aluminum versus wood versus styrofoam) do not appear to weigh the same (Ellis & Lederman,\n1998).

As Louw et al. (2000) comment, this raises an interestingquestion concerning the nature of the mechanism that limits haptic resolution (cf. photons for visual thresholds and Brownian movement ofthe air at the eardrum for auditory thresholds).\nHenriques and Soechting (2003) determined both absolute curvature detection and relative curvature discrimination of haptically explored\nvirtual arcs varying in curvature. Stimuli were presented within the horizontal plane at different locations and orientations within the work\nspace. The stimulus paths were suf \ufb01ciently large that all required large multijoint arm movements. For the absolute curvature task, observers\nwere asked to judge whether the stimulus path curved inward or outward from the body. No standard was presented. An adaptive double-staircase method was used to zero in quickly on threshold levels from both directions. In terms of the radius of curvature, the mean arc bias orpoint of subjective equality (PSE) was 1.8 m (0.56 m\n\u22121curvature), which represents the outward or inward value of curvature that observers\nwould judge as straight (i.e., without curvature). There were small differences in PSE that depended on the direction of the hand paths(sideways, front-back, diagonal left, and diagonal right). However, neither location in the work space nor distance from the observer affectedcurvature detection. The grand mean difference threshold for distinguishing between outward versus inward curvature was a radius of 0.90 m\n(1.11 m\n-1), which corresponded to the hand being displaced 0.16 cm in either direction from the bias arc. In the experiment on haptic\ncurvature discrimination, observers were required to decide which of two arcs was more curved. Stimulus pairs consisted of one straight \ufb01xed\nreference and one curved arc or two curved arcs, one of which was a \ufb01xed reference with a radius of curvature of 0.4 m (2.5 m\u22121curvature). A\nsingle adaptive-staircase procedure was used. The mean difference thresholds for the two curvature discrimination tasks were 0.44 m radius(2.26 m\n\u22121) and 0.35 m radius (2.88 m\u22121), respectively , both poorer than those obtained in the single-stimulus task in the previous experiment.\nThe investigators emphasized the important contributions of cutaneous feedback, which is provided when the hand grasps and moves themanipulandum and of kinesthetic feedback derived from the movement of the joints and muscles of the hand and arm.

Observers haptically discriminated angular\ndifferences between pairs of relatively large two-dimensional angles. They traced the pair of arms de \ufb01ning a two-dimensionalangl e with the\nindex \ufb01ngers of their outstretched arms. They were then required to decide which angle was larger, using a two-alternative, forced-choice\nprocedure. The discrimination threshold for 75% correct performance was 5.2 \u00b0. Voisin, Lamarre, and Chapman (2002) empirically con \ufb01rmed\nthat both cutaneous feedback from the \ufb01ngers and kinesthetic feedback from the shoulders contributed to judgments in the previous task.\nEliminating either source of sensory information raised angular thresholds, while eliminating both sources through passive touch with digitalanesthesia prevented observers from performing the task at all.\nAs previously observed with tactile sensing (Lechelt, 1988), people are not equally sensitive to all line orientations (Appelle & Gravetter, 1985;\nLechelt, Eliuk, & Tanne, 1976; Lederman & Taylor,1969). For example, Appelle and Gravetter (1985) and Lechelt et al. (1976) have con \ufb01rmed\nhaptic versions of the oblique effect, in which observers are less accurate when discriminating lines that are oriented obliquely than those\noriented either vertically or horizontally. Observers may use the more accurately perceived horizontal and vertical axes as perceptual anchorswhen haptically judging orientation (Lederman & Taylor, 1969). More recently , Gentaz and Hatwell (1995) have shown that the oblique effectoccurs in both frontal and sagittal planes, whether the ipsilateral (same side) or contralateral (opposite side) hands are used during theexploration and response phases. It occurs in the horizontal plane as well, but only in the contralateral condition. As the orientation anisotropyoccurs in all three spatial planes, Gentaz and Hatwell have suggested that the effect may depend on gravitational cues provided by the hand-\narm system. When the active haptic mode is used, observers have access to information about orientation from cutaneous deformation\npatterns on the \ufb01ngertip, from the kinesthetic feedback resulting from manual exploration (particularly the contour-following EP), and\npossibly from corollary discharges.\nSize\nThe exponent for the psychophysical function describing haptically perceived length as a function of physical length is a power function withan exponent close to 1, indicating that unlike most other sensory judgments, there is excellent correspondence between perceived and physicallength (Teghtsoonian & Teghtsoonian, 1965). In this experiment, observers used a magnitude-estimation procedure to judge the length of rodsheld statically at their ends by their two index \ufb01ngers. In another experiment, they were required to judge the apparent width of blocks held\nbetween their index \ufb01nger and the thumb of the same hand (Teghtsoonian & Teghtsoonian, 1970). Haptically perceived width was an\naccelerating function of physical length. As the best \ufb01tting power function had an exponent of 1.19, this means that doubling the block width\nincreased the felt width by a factor of 2.3. The difference in the exponents for the two experiments may relate to the fact that the openingbetween the two digits was more limited anatomically in the 1970 study.\nIn some cases, the perception of size is systematically distorted.

Susceptibility to theillusion was reduced when observers were instructed to use body-centered cues, but not when they were provided with an external, spatialreference in the form of an externalframe. This seems reasonabl e inasmuch as body-centered cues are known to be important for spatial\nprocessing by the haptic system (Ballesteros, Millar, & Reales, 1998; Millar, 1985). A similar reduction has been documented when observersused body-centered cues with the visualform of the M \u00fcller-Lyer illusion.\nRecall another powerful illusion of length distortion that has been demonstrated both visually and haptically: the horizontal-vertical illusion\n(\ufb01gure 4.18). A vertical line is consistently overestimated relative to a horizontal line of the same length. However, the distortion may be\nbroken down into two separate components: a bisection effect and a radial-tangential effect. The bisection effect consists of the bisected linebeing underestimated relative to the bisecting line, as demonstrated with T-shaped \ufb01gures. Similar bisection effects have been documented\nboth visually and haptically. However, the radial-tangential effect (Heller & Joyner, 1993; Marchetti & Lederman, 1983; Wong, 1977), ananisotropy of space, only occurs haptically . Wong (1977) proposed that radial movements toward and away from the body are overestimatedrelative to those that are tangential to the body. Fasse, Hogan, Kay, and Mussa-Ivaldi (2000) expanded the earlier investigations of haptically\ndistorted space to include manual interaction with virtual objects. Observers were required to make judgments about the geometric properties\nof simulated objects, such as rectangular and triangular holes. The geometric properties included relative length, relative angle magnitude, and\nabsolute object orientation. Observers demonstrated notable distortions in their haptic perception of all three properties; however, counter to\nprediction, their spatial percepts were geometrically inconsistent across those properties. These results clearly demonstrate the criticalimportance of exploratory movements in the haptic perception of size.\nA different distortion of haptic space occurs when observers are required to reproduce the perceived Euclidean distance between two points.\nEuclidean estimates are progressively overestimated as the length of the complex curvilinear pathway connecting the end points increases, as\nshown in \ufb01gure 5.9 (Lederman, Klatzky, & Barber, 1985).

For example, Lakatos and Marks (1999) showed that when judging the relative similarity of pairs of geometric objects,\nhaptic observers tend to focus more on local shape features than on global shape at the start, particularly when the time allowed forexploration is relatively brief. When rating the similarity of objects that are fairly similar in their global shape but not with respect to their loca l\nfeatures, observers tend to decrease their emphasis on the local features as exploration time is increased, as shown in \ufb01gure 5.11.

Such limited information can prove useful for\nlearning about the parameters of the spatial layout (de \ufb01ned with respect to some spatialreference system) and for properl y guiding one's hands\nto objects during reaching and manipulation.\nWhen observers are required to set a test bar parallel to a reference bar within a planar (horizontal) work space, they demonstrate systematic\nbiases in their perceptions of peripersonal space depending on the location and the task (unimanual or bimanual parallel bar setting, two-barcollinear setting, or pointing a test bar toward a marker; for details, see Kappers, 1999; Kappers & Koenderink, 1999). Zuidhoek, Kappers,van der Lubbe, and Postma (2003) interpreted the occurrence of consistent biases over many locations in these different tasks as indicatingthat the same egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (centered in external space) frames of reference were used by the haptic system. To\nthe extent that this is so, they predicted that providing a 10-s delay between the presentations of reference and test bars should reduce the\ndistortion normally introduced by using an egocentric frame of reference when there is no delay. Their results con \ufb01rmed that orientation\nerrors were reduced in the delay condition, although this was limited to when the horizontal distance between the bars was 120, but not 60,cm. They interpreted their results as indicating a shift during the delay interval from using an egocentric to an allocentric frame of reference.\nKlatzky and Lederman (2003b) have proposed that observers can adopt haptic spatial representations of manipulatory space at different levels.\nFigure 5.12 shows the levels of representation proposed, together with the successive computations required and the parameters representedat each level. Tasks were devised that demanded the use of different levels of representation. It was assumed that extracting parameters directlyfrom a representation would produce smaller errors than when it was necessary to compute a higher level of representation so as to access the\nparameters required by the task. Observers were instructed to encode both the locations at which contact occurred and their spatial\ncon\ufb01guration.

The observers' index \ufb01ngers were moved passively by the experimenter to two locations in space for several seconds, then\nback to the start position.

Based on their \ufb01ndings, Klatzky and Lederman concluded that their observers adopted a purely\nkinesthetic representation based on internalposturalcues when asked to return their \ufb01ngers to previously contacted positions. As indicated,\nsuch a representation preserves location information relatively well. However, metric parameters of the con \ufb01guration (distance, angle) must be\nderived from this representation. The latter were mediated by an accurately oriented but more poorly scaled representation of thecon\ufb01guration of the contact locations that was not tied to a speci \ufb01c location in space. The fact that scale was not precisely represented may\nexplain why people tend to adopt more ad hoc strategies for estimating distance (Lederman, Klatzky, & Barber, 1985).\nWe conclude this section by considering how our understanding of haptic space perception may be further informed by two intriguing\nperceptualdistortions of space. The \ufb01rst is known as the Aristotle illusion (McKeon, 1941, as cited in Benedetti, 1985). When crossing one\n\ufb01nger over an adjacent \ufb01nger and then contacting a small ball with the two \ufb01ngertips, people typically perceive two balls, not one. Benedetti\n(1985, 1986, 1988) used this illusion of external space in a series of papers that experimentally addressed how people process spatialinformation with crossed \ufb01ngers. For example, in the 1985 study, observers were required to touch simultaneously a sharp point at the center\nof a disk and a ball at a \ufb01xed objective position directly to the side of the point. The third and fourth \ufb01ngers were placed in three different\npositions: normalposition, the third crossed over the fourth \ufb01nger, and the third crossed under the fourth \ufb01nger. Figure 5.13A shows the\nexperimentalparadigm for the third \ufb01nger crossed over the fourth \ufb01nger. The tactile inputs were processed very differently, depending on the\nrelative orientation of the two \ufb01ngers. Figure 5.13B depicts the spatialpercepts corresponding to when the third \ufb01nger was crossed under,\nversus over, the fourth \ufb01nger. In a subsequent experiment, the fourth \ufb01nger was \ufb01xed while the third \ufb01nger was rotated to different\nFigure 5.13.

The illusion is reminiscent of our experience at the dentist's of \ufb01ce when\nwe perceive a cavity explored with the tongue to be larger after anesthesia (Anstis, 1964).

Dynamic touch occurs when an object is grasped and wielded in some way (e.g., raised, lowered,\npushed, turned, transported). The primary focus of the research on dynamic touch is how people perceptually judge the attributes of objects\nwielded in the hand, including, for example, length, weight, width, shape of the object tip, and the orientation of hand and object relative toeach other. Turvey and his colleagues have presented a substantial body of empirical evidence to support their argument that \u201cthe spatial\ncapabilities of dynamic touch result from the sensitivity of the body's tissues to certain quantities of rotational dynamics about a \ufb01xed point\nthat do not vary with changes in the rotationalforces (torques) and motions \u201d(1996, p. 1134). More speci \ufb01cally, Turvey describes resistance to\nwielding in the form of an inertia tensor, a 3 \u00d73 matrix whose elements represent the resistance to rotational acceleration about the axes of a\nthree-dimensionalcoordinate system imposed on the object around the center of rotation (i.e., the wrist). The eigen val ues of the matrixcorrespond to the principalmoments of inertia or the resistances to rotation about a nonarbitrary coordinate system that uses the primary axes\nof the object (i.e., those around which the mass is balanced). He further proposes that the perceived attributes directly map onto speci \ufb01c\npatterns of components (eigen values and eigen vectors) of the inertia tensor, with the speci \ufb01c feature determining which component.\nFor example, in one experiment, Solomon, Turvey, and Burton (1989) required their observers to judge the length of rods ranging from 0.61\nto 0.91 m by dynamically hefting them. They indicated their response by placing a board that could be seen at the distance that matched their\nperception of the location of the tip of the unseen rod. The investigators proposed that perceived length maps onto the moments of inertia(i.e., resistance to being turned). To test this, they altered the distribution of mass for a \ufb01xed point of rotation by attaching a weight at\nincreasing distances from the hand, as shown in \ufb01gure 5.14A. The moment of inertia increases the farther the rotationalaxis is from the center\nof mass. In another experiment, they changed the moment of inertia by changing the position of the point of rotation. Observers were\nrequired to grasp the rods at different positions along the rods, as shown in \ufb01gure 5.14B, thus altering the distance of the rotational axis from\nthe center of mass.

They proposed that haptic weight perception, both veridical and illusory (i.e., the size-weight illusion), is based on the resistance torotation imposed on the limbs as one holds or wields an object. They argued that such information derives directly from the inertia tensorrather than from some cognitive inference pertaining to heaviness that is based on integrating mass and volume percepts. To obtain evidencefor their theoretical stance on the haptic size-weight illusion, they created tensor objects in order to manipulate directly the pattern of eigen\nvalues associated with traditional size-weight objects, while holding both mass and volume constant. The results showed that haptically\nperceived heaviness changes in ways predicted by the speci \ufb01c pattern of resistance to rotationalaccel eration, despite the fact that neither mass\nnor volume changed.\nThe study of dynamic touch does not relate to touch as traditionally de \ufb01ned by tactile or haptic sensing.

To date, dynamic touch experiments\nhave typically involved wielding relatively large stimulus objects, as opposed to the smaller ones that are more commonly manipulated (e.g.,\npens, pencils, forks).\nDespite the value of studying dynamic touch with respect to motor function, the research program has tended to focus more on the use of\ndynamic touch for purposes of object perception. Observers in dynamic touch experiments have typically been required to make perceptual\njudgments about different object properties (e.g., length, weight, width, shape of the object tip, and orientation of hand and object relative toeach other) by wielding. The case to be made for studying the conscious perception of objects and their properties by wielding seems mostrelevant to understanding human tool use and teleoperation with larger end effectors.\nOne\ufb01nalissue that has been frequentl y raised by opponents of dynamic touch and its theoreticalunderpinnings pertains to the absence of any\nattempt to relate the critical mathematical constructs in their theory to neurophysiology. There are no known biological sensors in muscles that\nrespond to the inertia tensor or any of its components, whether singly or in some combination. How then does the observer/actor directly\ndetermine eigen vectors and eigen values as required by the theory? Any mapping between a percept and the inertia tensor cannot be directbecause these parameters too must be calculated from the available receptor outputs.\nSensory Gating with Active Movements\nResearch has shown that voluntary or active movements of the limb will reduce the transmission of cutaneous signals through the dorsalcolumn-medial lemniscal pathway during movement (Chapman, 1994; see the section \u201cSensory CorticalProjections \u201din chapter 3). Such\nmovement-related gating also impairs perception. Motor activity reduces both the detection of near-threshold cutaneous stimuli (i.e., detection\nthresholds increase) and the perceived magnitude of suprathreshold vibrotactile stimuli. Discrimination thresholds remain unchanged, perhaps\nbecause the relative differences between the pairs of stimuli are retained. If voluntary movements generally reduce perceived stimulusmagnitude, then how can we explain the apparent equivalence in pattern recognition and perceived roughness magnitude using active versuspassive modes of touch, as previously noted in this chapter? Chapman (1994) suggests that more ef \ufb01cient active controlover the touching\nprocess may serve to counteract the effect of movement-related gating.\nSensing via Intermediate Links\nUp to this point, we have considered active haptic perception with the bare hand. However, people also explore real and virtual worldsindirectly using a variety of tools, probes, skin covers, and more recently, haptic interfaces. Some of these devices can be very simple (e.g., apoint-contact device, such as a pencil), while others can be extremely complex (e.g., a robotic hand) with many degrees of freedom, forcesensors, and haptic display of the sensed forces. We will reserve discussion of the more complex haptic interfaces for teleoperation and virtual-\nenvironment applications until chapter 10.\nVibration Sensitivity\nBrisben, Hsiao, and Johnson (1999) have shown that when observers actively grasp a cylindrical rod that contains an embedded motor that\nproduces vibration parallel to the axis of the cylinder, some observers could sense vibrations at 200 Hz that were less than 0.01 \u03bcmi n\namplitude.

Lederman and Klatzky have adopted a psychophysical approach to understanding the remote perception of roughness via rigid probes\n(Klatzky & Lederman, 2002; Lederman & Klatzky, 2001). The surfaces consist of spatially jittered, two-dimensional raised-dot patternsvarying in interdot spacing. The shape of the psychophysical roughness functions (i.e., log perceived roughness magnitude as a function of log\ninterdot spacing) obtained with a rigid probe frequently differs from the linear functions more typically obtained with the bare \ufb01nger. The\ncorresponding probe-based functions are consistently quadratic, as shown in \ufb01gure 5.16 (but see Connor et al., 1990), and are based solely on\nthe vibrations generated when the probe is moved across a surface. Klatzky, Lederman, Hamilton, Grindley, and Swendsen (2003) argue that\nthe quadratic function is determined by the contact mechanics as the tip of the rigid probe rides along the tops of the elements; beyond some\ninterelement spacing value, the tip drops down into and across the base of the intervening spaces and up and over the leading edges of the\nsuccessive elements. The resulting psychophysical functions are quadratic in shape, the peak indicating the point along the interelement spacingcontinuum where the probe begins to fall between the elements (the drop point).

Finally, for both tapping and pressing, observers were more accurate when they actively initiated contactwith the object than when they were passively contacted by the specimen. Presumably, the higher success in the active condition is the result ofthe additional kinesthetic cues that become available during active sensing.\nRecognition and Discrimination of Object Material\nKatz (1925/1989) suggested that although people do not typically use the hand to identify particular materials, such as wood, metal,\ncardboard, and porcelain, remotely it may be possible to do so based on the vibrotactile cues generated by contact between the material and an\nintermediary link (e.g., \ufb01ngernail, rigid probe held in the hand). For example, he observed that, with their ears plugged, observers could\nsuccessfully recognize an iron plate by striking the surface with a hammer very brie \ufb02y( 3\u20135 ms)., Katz also provided clear evidence that\nmaterial discrimination was relatively unaffected when observers were required to differentiate \ufb01ne paper differences through a layer of glue or\nadhesive tape or with a wooden rod. Under such circumstances, the primary information would be in the form of vibration differences,presumably generated by the variations in surface texture. As Katz further noted, under normal circumstances, a perceiver would also haveaccess to a wealth of auditory information generated by contact between the intermediate link and the surface. Such acoustic cues areparticularly useful for recognizing and identifying speci \ufb01c materials. Cutaneous pressure and kinesthetic cues offer yet additional sources of\nsensory information about the relative compliance of various materials. Thermal cues, normally available for identifying materials through\ndirect contact, are usually missing; however, researchers are now attempting to provide such information arti \ufb01cially in the form of thermal\ndisplays that simulate the changes in skin temperature that occur on contact with an object (Ho & Jones, 2004).\nShape and Size\nPeople can be quite good at judging speci \ufb01c materialproperties (e.g., roughness, compl iance) with a rigid probe or rigid \ufb01nger sheath (e.g.,\nKlatzky & Lederman, 1999; Lederman & Klatzky, 1999). Like direct touch, however, remote touch via a rigid link (e.g., probe, \ufb01nger sheath)\nslows people down or renders them inaccurate when identifying common objects that are classi \ufb01ed primarily by their geometric features\n(Lederman & Klatzky, 2004). The implications of these results will also be discussed in chapter 10.\nIn this chapter, we have considered the sensory performance of the hand when active haptic sensing is used. This topic is further addressed\nwhen we deal with end-effector constraints in chapter 8, hand function across the lifespan in chapter 9, and applied aspects of hand function inchapter 10.

The task\nobjective is usually de \ufb01ned in terms of the action that will be performed with the object (e.g., drinking from a cup, writing with a pen).\nAlthough it is important to know the properties of the object, such as its shape or weight, in order to accomplish the task, this is usuallyconsidered secondary to the task's objective. This is best exempli \ufb01ed by the complaint of people with damage to the peripheral nerves\ninnervating the sensory receptors in the hand, who complain not of the attendant sensory loss but of their motor de \ufb01ciencies, which are\nevident in their clumsiness and dif \ufb01culties in grasping and holding objects (Moberg, 1962).\nExperimentalstudies of prehension have examined how the hand is transported and con \ufb01gured to grasp and manipulate objects. This has\nbeen studied in terms of the kinematics of hand and \ufb01nger movements, the coordination of \ufb01ngertip forces as the object is grasped, and the\nrole of visual and somatosensory feedback in these processes. In general, studies that focus on reaching have emphasized the kinematic\nfeatures of the hand and arm movements as the hand reaches to grasp an object and have been performed independently from thoseconcerned with grasping. Studies of grasping generally start at the point of contact with the object and concentrate on analyzing how the forcesproduced by the \ufb01ngers as an object is grasped and lifted are adapted to the properties of the object. These studies have also investigated the\ncontribution of afferent feedback from cutaneous and muscle mechanoreceptors to the modulation of \ufb01nger forces.\nReaching to Grasp\nThere are severalcl asses of reaching movements that can be differentiated on the basis of the accuracy requirements of the movement and the\ncon\ufb01guration of the hand as the arm moves. Pointing, aiming, and reaching-to-grasp movements generally have similar kinematic features\neven though reaching-to-grasp movements involve changing the posture of the hand as the movement progresses so that it can grasp an\nobject.

In this chapter on prehension, we\nwill review the literature on reaching movements that involve moving the arm so that an object can be grasped. Pointing and aiming\nmovements are treated as non-prehensile skilled movements and will be examined in chapter 7.\nThe act of reaching and grasping an object involves at least three distinct phases: moving the arm from its initial position to a location near the\nobject (the reaching or transport phase), adjusting the posture of the hand as it approaches the object so that it can be grasped (the grasp\nphase), and \ufb01nally the actual manipulation of the object (manipulation phase). This \ufb01nalphase wil lbe covered in the section on grasping. The\n\ufb01rst two phases are coordinated in space and time as will be described below . The reaching or transport phase of the movement is typically\nconsidered in terms of the kinematics of the wrist's movements and so variables such as movement time, velocity pro \ufb01le, peak acceleration,\nand peak height are analyzed from data recorded from sensors (e.g., electromagnetic angular position sensors), passive re \ufb02ective markers, or\ninfrared emitting diodes (IREDs) mounted on the wrist and hand. The transport phase of reaching is usually characterized by a bell-shapedvelocity curve and a single acceleration and deceleration peak (Jeannerod, 1984). Figure 6.1 shows the trajectory of the hand as it reaches tograsp objects located at three different distances from the observer, the bell-shaped relation between hand velocity and movement durationduring these movements, and the relation between grip size and movement duration. The velocity curve becomes more asymmetrical with aprolonged deceleration phase when the object being grasped becomes smaller or more fragile (Marteniuk, Leavitt, MacKenzie, & Athenes,\n1990). In general, the trajectory of the wrist during reaching movements does not vary as a function of movement speed or load on the arm\n(Soechting & Lacquaniti, 1981). However, movements to more distant objects have a longer latency, accelerate to peak velocity more quickly\nwhile attaining a higher peak velocity, and take longer than movements to near objects (Jakobson & Goodale, 1991).\nDuring a reach-to-grasp movement, the posture of the hand changes as it is shaped to conform to the dimensions and properties of the target\nobject. A number of kinematic features have been used to characterize these changes in the con \ufb01guration of the hand, with the objective of\ndetermining how the hand's posture changes as the arm moves toward the target object and how the arm and hand trajectories arecoordinated in space and time. The movement of the hand is usually recorded from markers or sensors placed on the tips of the thumb andindex \ufb01nger and sometimes on the joints of other \ufb01ngers, if a more comprehensive analysis of the grasping motion is required (e.g., Mason,\nGomez, & Ebner, 2001). A motion-analysis system is then used to calculate the position in space of the body points on which the markers orIREDs are mounted (e.g., Gentilucci, Castiello, Corradini, Scarpa, Umilta, & Rizzolatti, 1991). In some studies, a glove with sensors embedded\nin its surface has been worn so that measurements of the metacarpophal angeal(MP) and proximalinterphal angeal(PIP) joint angl es of the\nfour\ufb01ngers can be made in addition to recording the MP and interphalangeal joint angle of the thumb (Santello & Soechting, 1998).

The change in grip apertureand velocity as a function of movement time are shown in Figure 6.2 for objects varying in width from 2 to 5 cm and in distance from 20 to 40cm.

A dissociation between visually perceived\nobject properties (vision for perception) and the voluntary movements executed to interact with those objects (vision for action) has beennoted in other contexts. For example, Aglioti, DeSouza, and Goodale (1995) showed that when a visual illusion (Titchener's circles) is used tochange the apparent size of an object, it has no effect on the maximalaperture of the grip when reaching for it. However, when the perceivedlength of an object is modi \ufb01ed using the M \u00fcller-Lyer illusion, there is a small effect on grip aperture (Daprati & Gentilucci, 1997) and on the\ngrasp position adopted for a balanced lift (Ellis, Flanagan, & Lederman, 1999). In the latter two studies, the effect of the visual illusion ongrasp was much smaller than the visually perceived changes; the results are, therefore, still consistent with the idea of some dissociation\nbetween visual perception and visually guided action (see Milner & Goodale, 1995).\nThe point in time at which the aperture of the hand is at its maximum is readily identi \ufb01able and occurs during the deceleration phase of the\nreaching movement.

In two-digit and whole-hand grasps, the peak aperture occurs at\napproximately 60 \u201370% of the total movement time, as illustrated in \ufb01gure 6.2 (Chief \ufb01& Gentilucci, 1993; Santello & Soechting, 1998). At this\npoint, the correlation between the hand posture and its \ufb01nalcon \ufb01guration is not strong, but after the peak aperture is reached, the hand shape\nbecomes more distinct and its form more closely resembles that of the target object. Multivariate statistical analyses of the changes in \ufb01nger\njoint angles during the latter part of the reaching movement indicate that it is possible to distinguish between concave and convex targetobjects from the relative amount of \ufb02exion in the index and little \ufb01ngers (together) as compared to the ring and middle \ufb01ngers (Santello &\nSoechting, 1998). These analyses reveal that despite the large number of mechanical degrees of freedom available during grasping, the number\nof independent degrees of freedom actively controlled is considerably smaller.

In addition to these changes in the grasping component of the movement, there is a marked increase in the frequency with which the\nobject slips between the \ufb01ngers as it is grasped. The latter \ufb01nding indicates the important role played by tactile afferents in signaling the initial\ncontact with an object and is consistent with microneurographic studies of these units, which show a burst of activity in FA I and SAI units atthe beginning of contact with an object (Westling & Johansson, 1987).\nVisuomotor and Digit-channel Theories of Reaching\nOn the basis of a number of studies of reaching to grasp an object, Jeannerod (1984) proposed that the visuomotor mechanisms involved inreaching and grasping an object are independent, but temporally coupled. This became known as the \u201cvisuomotor channelhypothesis \u201dand\nhas been the subject of extensive study and debate (e.g., Jeannerod, 1988; Smeets & Brenner, 1999). Reaching was hypothesized to involve the\ntransport channel, which extracts spatial information from the environment on the location of objects and on the distance of objects from the\nobserver, and so deals with the extrinsic properties of objects. This channel then generates the motor commands that activate the musclesinvolved in moving the hand and arm to the object. The manipulation channel is involved in grasping, and it extracts information concerningthe size and shape of the object (intrinsic properties) and then transforms that information into commands for the distalmuscul ature, whichgrasps the object. Jeannerod (1988) observed that these two channels are frequently synchronized. He noted that as a person reaches to graspan object, the time to maximum hand aperture, which is a function of object size, occurs at approximately 70% of the total movement time\nand always occurs at the same relative point in time, independent of movement duration (Jeannerod, 1984).\nA number of studies have called into question the independence of the transport and manipulation channels as proposed by Jeannerod. The\ndistance of the object from the observer and its size, shape, and fragility have been shown to affect both components of reaching (Santello &Soechting, 1998). The maximum aperture of the hand is scaled to the object's size, and its occurrence is correlated with the deceleration peakof the transport phase (Gentilucci, Chief \ufb01, Scarpa, & Castiello, 1992). In addition, both the transport time and peak velocity of the reaching\nmovement vary as functions of object size (Jakobson & Goodale, 1991; Marteniuk et al., 1987). If the size or position of the object is suddenlychanged during the course of a reaching movement, adjustments are made to both the transport and grasping components within 100 ms,again showing a dependence of the two (Paulignan, MacKenzie, Marteniuk, & Jeannerod, 1991; Paulignan, Jeannerod, MacKenzie, &Marteniuk, 1991). Finally, if the arm is unexpectedly perturbed as it reaches for an object, there is a compensatory adjustment of both the wrist\ntrajectory and the hand aperture. In this situation, it appears as if the spatialrel ation between the components of the reaching movement is\nbeing preserved (Haggard & Wing, 1991). These \ufb01ndings from a diverse set of experiments suggest that the controlmechanisms underl ying\nreaching and grasping are affected by the same task constraints and that temporaland kinematic coupl ing is a requirement for the accuratecontrolof arm transport and manipul ation.\nSmeets and Brenner (1999) have proposed an alternative to the visuomotor channel hypothesis in which they suggest that there are separate\nchannels for the \ufb01nger and thumb during reaching and", "doc_id": "8df1971c-dbeb-4dda-9c14-ac92117cc474", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2039a9b35442a5759e20f83fd020a62158b732069df7f74813f65863ea1410c7", "extra_info": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3804}, "relationships": {"1": "fa60f612-b3e0-4b03-bb29-0f12c08b90ee", "3": "bfa26d5c-d92e-4e93-afb3-121de44849a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfa26d5c-d92e-4e93-afb3-121de44849a7": {"__data__": {"text": "the arm is unexpectedly perturbed as it reaches for an object, there is a compensatory adjustment of both the wrist\ntrajectory and the hand aperture.

In this conceptualization, grasping is essentially reduced to an analysis of\npointing with the thumb and \ufb01nger and is modeled by a minimum-jerk ( \ufb01rst derivative of acceleration) approach (described in chapter 7 for\npointing movements). The \u201cdigit channel \u201dhypothesis (Mon-Williams & McIntosh, 2000), as this model has been termed, postulates that the\ndigits approach the object's surface perpendicularly and that grasping simply involves moving the \ufb01ngers and thumb to the correct spatial\nlocations. This hypothesis avoids one limitation of the visuomotor channel hypothesis, namely, determining what part of the hand is controlledduring the transport phase of grasping, and can account for changes in hand posture with variations in the orientation of the target object. In\nthe latter case, the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the object remain unchanged, but the grip size and movement of the arm can change\nwith the object's orientation (Smeets & Brenner, 1999).

Analyses of the \ufb01nalspatialpositions of the \ufb01ngers on an object indicate that they do vary with its size\n(Gentilucci, Caselli, & Secchi, 2003), center of mass (Lederman & Wing, 2003), and intended use (Napier, 1956). Gentilucci et al. (2003)reported that when observers used a tripod grasp to pick up spheres varying in diameter from 18 to 65 mm, the position of the thumbremained relatively constant along the sagittal, transverse, and vertical axes, although its relative position on the spheres changed with size. In\ncontrast, the position of both the index and middle \ufb01ngers changed along the sagittal and vertical axes with variation in object size. These\nresults are consistent with the concept that grasping involves two \u201cvirtual \ufb01ngers\u201dformed by the thumb and one or more \ufb01ngers that act in\nopposition to it, as proposed by Arbib, Iberall, and Lyons (1985). This concept is discussed more fully in chapter 8. The relative invariance ofthe thumb's position is also consistent with the hypothesis that it is the motion of the thumb, rather than the wrist, that is planned in thereaching movement (Haggard & Wing, 1997).\nThe placement of the \ufb01ngers on an object is in \ufb02uenced by its perceived center of mass, which needs to be taken into consideration for\nasymmetrically shaped objects. If such an object is grasped at offaxis contact points, it will become unstable and begin to rotate in the hand.The in \ufb02uence of object symmetry on grasp-point selection was studied by Lederman and Wing (2003) using a range of planar objects that\nwere either symmetric or asymmetric in shape. Observers were required to grasp and lift these objects using the thumb and middle \ufb01nger, and\nthe spatial location of the digits on the objects was recorded. They found that the grasp axes formed by the thumb and middle \ufb01nger passed\nthrough or were close to the center of mass of the objects. The average error, which was de \ufb01ned as the perpendicular distance of the grasp axis\nfrom the center of mass, was only 3 \u20134 mm. Furthermore, the error for grasping symmetric objects was 31% lower than that for asymmetric\nobjects. A stable grasp was therefore achieved based on object geometry, including visual cues to symmetry.\nVisual Feedback and Reaching\nWhen reaching for an object, the centralnervous system makes use of visualinformation about the l ocation of the object and proprioceptivefeedback regarding the position of the arm and hand, so that it can produce a pattern of muscle activity that moves the arm toward the object.The object's position must be computed in body-centered visualspace, whereas the position of the moving arm with respect to that of the\nobject is calculated from proprioceptive signals. If the position of the object suddenly changes during a reaching movement, corrections to the\nmovement trajectory can be made within 100 ms, which is the minimum delay needed for visual and proprioceptive afferent signals to\nin\ufb02uence the movement (Paulignan, Jeannerod, et al., 1991).

In some studies, visualfeedback of the arm has been el iminated at different times during the reachingmovement by using liquid crystal spectacles that can switch from a transparent to occluding state in 3 ms (e.g., Winges et al., 2003).

When visual feedback is\neliminated, there are predictable changes in the temporal and, to a lesser extent, spatial pro \ufb01les of the reach-to-grasp movement. However, it is\nimportant to note that whether observers use visualcues to guide reaching movements can depend on the predictabil ity of these cues. If visualfeedback is randomized so that observers do not know in advance whether visual feedback will be continuously available, in some studies theyhave tended to adopt a default strategy in which they operate as if no visual cues are available, even when they are (Jakobson & Goodale,\n1991).\nWhen visual feedback of the arm is eliminated as people reach to grasp a visible object under normal illumination, the duration of the\nmovement increases in comparison to movements made with full visual feedback, as shown in \ufb01gure 6.3 (Connolly & Goodale, 1999). The\nmaximum aperture of the hand and the relative time taken to reach maximum aperture remains unchanged, even though the arm is occluded\nfrom view (Connolly & Goodale, 1999). This suggests that the posture of the hand can be controlled without direct visual feedback,presumably on the basis of proprioceptive feedback from the hand and visual cues from the object. These results differ from those reported inan earlier study by Jakobson and Goodale (1991) in which there was an increase in the maximum grip aperture in the absence of visualfeedback. In this study, the open-loop trials (i.e., no visual feedback) were run in complete darkness, and the increase in grip aperture may havebeen a compensatory strategy adopted by observers as it permitted them to make more adjustments of the hand during the course of the\nmovement. Churchill et al. (2000) also noted that there were differences in the grip aperture when the unseen hand reached in darkness for a\nluminous object.\nContinuous vision of the object as the hand reaches toward it is not essentialfor the hand to be preshaped to the object's geometry. However,\nwithout continuous visual input, the reaching movements are longer, particularly during the \ufb01nalapproach of the hand to the object as the\n\ufb01ngers close (Winges et al., 2003). In these experiments, vision of the arm and object was occluded at different latencies (0 \u2013750 ms) from the\nstart of the reaching movement. The hand path remained fairly consistent in the different visual conditions, and the kinematics of themovement (i.e., peak wrist velocity , time to peak velocity) did not change. The rate at which the hand was shaped to \ufb01t the geometry of the\nobject was also not affected by reducing the time during which visual feedback was available. These \ufb01ndings indicate that the con \ufb01guration of\nthe hand as it reaches for an object is computed prior to movement onset and that it can be updated or modi \ufb01ed on the basis of\nproprioceptive information from the \ufb01ngers. If these proprioceptive signals are not available because the person has a peripheral neuropathy\nthat affects afferent feedback from the arm and hand, then large directional and amplitude errors occur when reaching for an object without\nvisualfeedback (J. Gordon, Ghil ardi, & Ghez, 1995).\nWhen reaching movements are made using only haptic and proprioceptive cues, that is, when participants\nFigure 6.3.

Both tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the hand provide information that can be used to\ncompensate for the loss of visual feed-back, and on their own, they provide suf \ufb01cient information to enable a person to reach and grasp an\nobject.\nGrasping\nResearch on grasping has received considerable attention since the 1980s, and the topics covered range from how the intrinsic properties of anobject (e.g., its mass and surface texture) in \ufb02uence the grasping forces generated to how task constraints determine the choice of a particular\nhand con \ufb01guration. Most manipulative tasks require the precise coordination of forces generated at the \ufb01ngertips in order to hold the object in\na stable grasp. This has been studied extensively using an experimental apparatus and procedure \ufb01rst developed by Johansson and his\ncolleagues (Johansson & Westling, 1984). The protocol requires that a person grasp an object between the thumb and index \ufb01nger and lift it\nfrom a supporting surface. The temporal sequence of this process is broken down into a number of phases as follows: the preload phase inwhich the grip is formed; the loading phase in which there is a parallel increase in the grip force normal to the object surface and the load forcetangential to the surface until the load force overcomes gravity; the transitional phase when the object is lifted to the desired position; the staticphase in which the object is held stationary and the forces reach a steady state; the replacement phase in which the object is lowered to the\nresting position; and \ufb01nally the unloading phase when the object is \ufb01nally released from the hand (Johansson & Westling, 1984; Westling &\nJohansson, 1987).\nA schematic drawing of the grip-force apparatus, together with the temporalsequence of the experimentalprotocol , is shown in \ufb01gure 6.5.\nThis apparatus and experimental protocol have been widely adopted by researchers interested in human motor control (e.g., Flanagan & Wing,\n1995) and have been used to study \ufb01ne manual control in young children (Forssberg, Eliasson, Kinoshita, Johansson, & Westling, 1991), the\nelderly (Cole, 1991), and people with peripheral nerve (Nowak & Hermsd\u00f6rfer, 2003), cerebellar (M \u00fcller & Dichgans, 1994; Nowak,\nHermsd\u00f6rfer, Marquardt, & Fuchs, 2002), or cortical lesions (Hermsd\u00f6rfer, Hagl, & Nowak, 2004; Robertson & Jones, 1994). A similarexperimental apparatus was developed in the 1970s to study the effects of pyramidal tract lesions on precision grip control in monkeys (Hepp-Reymond et al., 1974; Hepp-Reymond & Wiesendanger, 1972).\nFigure 6.5.

The object itsel f may\nbe passive (e.g., a box whose weight or shape may vary) or active (a servo-controlled motor), with the latter enabling perturbations to bedelivered as the object is manipulated. The effects on grip forces of various object properties, such as the texture on the grasping surface, theshape and curvature of the object, and its weight, have been investigated. An additionalfocus of these studies has been on the rol e of\ncutaneous mechanoreceptors in the coordination of \ufb01ngertip forces.\nWhen an object is grasped with the thumb and index \ufb01nger and lifted from a supporting surface, the rate at which the grip (normal) and load\n(tangential) forces increase is maintained at an approximately constant ratio, which is consistent with a coordinated pattern of muscle activation\nin the hand and arm muscles (Johansson & Westling, 1988). Once the object is supported in a stable position during the static phase, the\nnormal force stabilizes and is approximately proportional to the weight of the object (see \ufb01gure 6.6). These normalforces have to be l arge\nenough to prevent the object from slipping between the \ufb01ngers but not excessive, as this may cause damage to a fragile object or muscle\nfatigue, if the forces have to be maintained for some period of time. The ratio of the normal(grip) force to the tangential(l oad) force mustexceed the inverse of the coef \ufb01cient of friction for a grip to be stable and an object secure. The minimum force at which an object begins to\nslip between the \ufb01ngers, known as the slip force, has been measured by asking people to extend the thumb and index \ufb01nger very slowly until\nthe object being held slips from the \ufb01ngers. Using this procedure, Westling and Johansson (1984) found that the slip force was proportional to\nthe load force and varied as a function of the friction between the skin and the object, as shown in \ufb01gure 6.6. A comparison between the grip\nand slip forces revealed that there were large interindividual differences in grip force, although the corresponding slip forces were equivalent.\nThey coined the term \u201csafety margin \u201dto describe this difference between the slip and grip forces and noted that this tended to be smaller in\nmore dexterous people.\nGrasp stability during manipulation is maintained by automatically increasing and decreasing the grip forces in parallel with the load force. If\nan object begins to slip between the \ufb01ngers, there is an automatic increase in grip force, which occurs within\nFigure 6.6.

This delay represents about half the latency of a voluntarily\ninitiated change in force that can be elicited by cutaneous stimulation of the \ufb01ngers and twice the latency of the fastest spinal re \ufb02ex in intrinsic\nhand muscles (Matthews, 1984). The latency is, however, comparable in magnitude to long-latency re \ufb02ex responses and so is presumably\nsupraspinally mediated. Microneu-rographic recordings indicate that these slips readily excite tactile units in the \ufb01ngerpad, even though they\nare usually not perceived. The slip responses are detected by FA I, FA II, and SA I mechanoreceptors, with the primary response coming fromFA I and SA I units (Johansson & Westling, 1987).\nEffect of Friction on Grip Forces\nThe friction between the skin of the hand and the object being grasped depends on the materialon the grasping surface, the ampl itude of the\ngrip force at low forces (< 1 N), the contact area, and the degree of hydration of the skin (Buchholz, Frederick, & Armstrong, 1988). The\nin\ufb02uence of friction on the forces used to grasp objects has been evaluated using materials such as silk or sandpaper, which are mounted on\nthe grasping surface. Westling and Johansson (1984) used Amonton's law to calculate the coef \ufb01cient of friction for sandpaper (grade 320),\nsuede, and silk in contact with skin and reported average values for 10 people of 1.21, 0.69, and 0.35, respectively . With these materialsmounted on the grip-force apparatus, they measured the change in normalforce as participants grasped and l ifted the test object. They foundthat, as the friction between the skin and object decreased, higher normal forces were required to maintain grasp stability , as illustrated in \ufb01gure\n6.6. The main effect of the different surface materials was on the rate with which the normal force changed during the preloading and loading\nphases, whereas the time course of the change in tangential force was similar for all three surfaces (see \ufb01gure 6.7). Force coordination therefore\nvaried as a function of surface material. This adjustment in force with surface material appeared to be based on friction per se, rather than the\ntexturalproperties of the object; when the skin was washed and made l ess adhesive, the normalforce was\nFigure 6.7.

The friction between the object surface and the\n\ufb01ngers not only in \ufb02uences the dynamics of prehensile force control as described above, but also affects the more proximal musculature in the\narm, such as the elbow and shoulder muscles that are involved in moving the hand and object from one location to another (Saels, Thonnard,Detrembleur, & Smith, 1999).\nWhen the surface materialin contact with the digits changes, the \ufb01nger forces are in \ufb02uenced by this new frictionalcondition within 100 ms of\nthe initialcontact. This initialadjustment in normalforce is sometimes insuf \ufb01cient and a further secondary adjustment in force occurs later\nduring the loading phase (Johansson & Westling, 1984).

Weight-related information is not available until the object is actuallylifted from the supporting surface, and so the grip and load forces must be programmed in anticipation of the movement, based on anestimate of the object's weight. With unfamiliar objects, people often infer the weight of the object by assuming a default density that is withinthe range of commonly encounteredPrehension 111", "doc_id": "dea92a1a-7a8f-49ad-9777-585d12c49724", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "750697067ffd72e3ca38bcf2c58f44b51ae3152afcad4891a1ceb4751cda075d", "extra_info": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3018, "end": 4914}, "relationships": {"1": "f44316a4-52a5-4314-b60b-e1935ef29305", "2": "2cdf451a-26bd-46f1-8400-eaaa984f39d3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "363a30be-c3bd-4271-8b0c-7b8e2705e8b6": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 6.8.

On some occasions, there is a mismatch between the anticipated force requirements\nand those apparent in the task. This can occur, for example, when there is a discrepancy between the predicted and actual weight of the object.Under these conditions, the force output is adjusted within 100 ms of object contact. Presumably, feedback from muscle spindle receptorssignals that the force produced is inappropriate for the task and that the object has not moved or moved too rapidly as it was grasped(Mace\ufb01eld & Johansson, 1996). After a single trial, the force rates are adapted to the object's weight, provided it remains constant (Johansson\n& Westling, 1988).\nWhen the \ufb01ngers have to restrain an active object, such as a servo-controlled motor, the grip forces are graded to the load amplitudes (resistive\nforces) in a similar manner to the adjustment to passive objects (Johansson, Riso, H\u00e4ger, & B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m, 1992; Jones & Hunter, 1992). There is\na proportional change in grip force with load force that serves to maintain an adequate safety margin that prevents slips, although the safety\nmargins employed with an active object are slightly higher than those used for passive objects being supported against gravity at similar loadforces (Johansson, Riso, et al., 1992). The higher safety margins may be due to the less predictable nature of the physical stimulus (i.e., motor),which can generate arbitrary forces at unanticipated rates rather rapidly. With the active object, the grip-force responses are adapted to the rateat which the load force changes, and the latency between the start of the loading phase and the onset of the grip response decreases withincreasing load-force rate over the range of 2 N/s to 32 N/s (Johansson, H\u00e4ger, & Riso, 1992). The latter \ufb01nding suggests that the grip\nresponses are elicited at some threshold load force, which will be reached more rapidly at higher load-force rates.\nA variety of grasp con \ufb01gurations and tasks has been used to examine the coordination of grip and load forces, including applying tangential\nloads to the hand either by tilting the object (Goodwin, Jenmalm, & Johansson, 1998) or using an object with its center of mass located off the\ngrip axis (Salimi, Hollender, Frazier, & Gordon, 2000).

Despite the presence of these destabilizing forces, the grip and load forces are\nmodulated concurrently with \ufb02uctuations in the acceleration-dependent inertial loads (Flanagan & Wing, 1995), and the predictive coupling of\ngrip and load forces occurs even during transitions between gravity levels (Hermsd\u00f6rfer et al., 2000). In addition, the scaling of the grip forcesis directly related to the minimum grip force required to maintain an adequate safety margin that prevents slips (Flanagan & Wing, 1995;Goodwin et al., 1998). When pushing and pulling forces are applied to the hand as it grasps an object, the grip forces produced are modulatedwith the applied load forces. However, this modulation is affected by the direction of the load force, as shown in \ufb01gure 6.9, with higher grip\nforces being produced in response to pulling load forces at larger force amplitudes, particularly for more slippery surfaces (Jones & Hunter,\n1992). The greater grip forces generated in response to the pull force suggest that the friction between the skin and the object varies as a\nfunction of the direction of load force, perhaps re \ufb02ecting differences in the anisotropic extensibility of the skin (Wilkes, Brown, & Wildnauer,\n1973).\nTactile mechanoreceptors in the \ufb01ngertips respond to the changes in normaland tangentialforces, with FA I and, to a l esser extent, SA I\nreceptors primarily signaling the changes in force during the preloading and early loading phases of lifting (Mace \ufb01eld, H\u00e4ger-Ross, &\nJohansson, 1996). Westling and Johansson (1987) proposed that the initial responses of the FA I and SA I units re \ufb02ect the skin deformation\nchanges that result from the increasing grip force. At low grip forces of around 1 N, the area of contact is approximately 70% of that at 5 N\n(Serina et al., 1997), as described in chapter 2 and shown in \ufb01gure 2.10. This means that the contact area increases rapidly with relatively small\nchanges in grip force. At force levels of around 0.5 N, it has been estimated that the receptive \ufb01elds of approximately 350 tactile units would be\nstimulated, and about 66% of these would be FA I units. At 1 N, approximately 450 tactile units would be stimulated, most of them extremelysensitive to small skin deformations (Westling & Johansson, 1987). As the grip force increases further, there is little additional\nFigure 6.9. Relation between motor force and pinch force for three different surfaces for a single participant.

During the static phase, when the grip force\nremains constant, SA II units discharge and are strongly in \ufb02uenced by both skin indentation and lateral forces, and so they also probably\ncontribute to the controlof \ufb01nger forces (Westling & Johansson, 1987). As described in chapter 3, it is these units that play a role in\nproprioception in the hand.\nObject's Shape and Size and Grip Forces\nBoth tactile and visual cues are used to modulate grasping forces, but their in \ufb02uence occurs at different points in the grasping process. Visual\ninformation is used primarily to identify the properties of the object, determine the grasp requirements, and make anticipatory adjustments tothe grip forces as the hand comes in contact with the object. Features that are identi \ufb01ed visually include shape, surface curvature, and object\nweight as predicted from size (Gordon, Forssberg, Johansson, & Westling, 1991a; Gordon et al., 1993; Jenmalm, Dahlstedt, & Johansson,\n2000). The shape of the object imposes constraints on force coordination, as the sum of the forces and moments applied must equal zero if\nthe object is to be held in a stable grasp. When the surface angle on the object increases (i.e., the object is tapered upward), both the normaland tangential forces increase as a function of surface angle; the balance between these forces is, however, maintained independently of thesurface angle, and so the safety margin remains constant (Jenmalm & Johansson, 1997). Even when tactile feedback from the \ufb01ngertips is\neliminated with digital anesthesia, the normal (grip) and tangential forces are still adjusted to the object's shape, which is visually perceived,although the grip forces are considerably larger when compared to those used for lifting with normal sensibility (Jenmalm & Johansson, 1997).\nSome geometric features, such as object curvature, have little or no effect on the magnitude of the grasping forces, but do in \ufb02uence the safety\nmargins that are used to prevent slips. Jenmalm. Goodwin, and Johansson (1998) reported that when people grasp objects with either concave\nor convex surfaces, the minimum grip forces required to prevent slips are in \ufb02uenced by surface curvature. Under these conditions, the slip\nratio is not only a function of the friction at the digit-object interface but is also affected by the characteristics of the mechanical contactbetween the \ufb01ngers and the object. They found that the safety margins adopted to prevent slips were higher for either concave or convex\nsurfaces as compared to those used for objects with \ufb02at surfaces.\nWhen people are asked to lift two objects of identical weight but varying in size, the smaller of the two objects is typically perceived to be\nheavier than the larger object, an effect known as the size-weight illusion (described in chapter 5). When these objects are lifted, however,participants quickly learn to scale the grip forces appropriately for the actual weight of each object, not its perceived weight, and so the grip\nforces during the holding phase of the lift are the same independent of object size (Flanagan & Beltzner, 2000; Gordon et al., 1991a). This\noccurs regardless of whether size is perceived visually (Gordon et al., 1991a) or haptically (Gordon, Forssberg, Johansson, & Westling, 1991b).\nObject's Center of Mass and Grasping\nIn most studies on prehension, the object is grasped with two \ufb01ngers, and the center of mass is usually midway between the \ufb01ngers in the\nplane of the two contact surfaces. In this situation, the load force at each digit is equal to half the object's weight.

In this situation, the load force at each digit is equal to half the object's weight. If the center of mass does notlie on the grip axis, then torques tangential to the grip surfaces can develop and result in the object rotating in the hand. To prevent theserotational slips, the grip forces must be scaled appropriately at each digit. If the center of mass is located distal to the grip axis that connects thetips of the digits, the grip forces are scaled to the resulting load torque (Wing & Lederman, 1998). When the center of mass is parallel to the\ngrip axis, that is, the center of mass is located laterally to the center of the object, the load forces must be partitioned asymmetrically at the\nthumb and index \ufb01nger if the object is to be lifted without tilting. Using this type of manipulation, Salimi et al. (2000) found that within three to\n\ufb01ve lifts, participants were able to modulate the load forces developed at the two grasping surfaces so that the object was lifted with minimal\ntilt. This anticipatory control of the force was, however, speci \ufb01c to the effectors manipulating the object.

Within a few trials, however, participants were able to scale the forces\ncorrectly and presumably had developed a stable internal representation of the object's center of mass.\nAnticipatory Models and Grasping\nThe anticipatory scaling of grip and load forces as the hand makes contact with an object has been proposed to result from an internal modelof the task that includes both its dynamic and kinematic characteristics. Previous manipulatory experience is used to develop an internalrepresentation of the relevant physical properties of objects and of the relation between these properties and the forces required to support theobjects. This modelthen contributes to the preprogramming of forces and to the modul ation of forces under different grasping conditions(e.g., when rotating the object in the hand). If visual cues about the object and its grasping surface are available prior to contact, they can be\nused to scale these grip forces and grasp kinematics (e.g., at which point to place the digits). If these cues are not available, shape and size can\nalso be perceived using tactile and kinesthetic information (Jenmalm & Johansson, 1997). If the object is novel, the scaling of grip forces to itsphysical properties is established within a few trials of lifting and persists in memory for up to 24 hours (Gordon et al., 1993). However, iftactile feedback from the \ufb01ngers is eliminated following local anesthesia, this internal model is unable to compensate for the lack of peripheral\nsensory information even though participants have had extensive experience lifting the object. Under these conditions, the grip forces remainconsistently high (Augurelle et al., 2003; Monzee et al., 2003). This suggests that continuous or relatively frequent sensory information fromthe\ufb01ngers is required for the internalmodelto function effectivel y .\nThe internalrepresentations of some of the properties of objects that are grasped do not depend on the particul ar end effector used to acquire\nthat information. Cues obtained using one hand regarding the texture (Johansson & Westling, 1984) or the weight (Gordon et al., 1993) of an\nobject are available to the other hand during subsequent lifts. In contrast, when an object's center of mass does not lie in the grip axis,information about the center of mass is not represented in a way that other end effectors can utilize when they make initial contact with theobject (Salimi et al., 2000). This suggests that there may be different levels of representation of different object properties that may re \ufb02ect the\ncoordination required to execute the task. The instances in which there have not been transfers of these object properties (i.e., center of massand different textures at each digit) are those in which there must be a partitioning of the force responses at the two digits in contact with theobject, and so they cannot be controlled as a unit.\nIt has been suggested that there must be many internalmodel s within the centralnervous system that represent the properties of objects\nencountered in the environment (Witney , 2004), given the ease with which people can switch between objects in their daily manual activities.\nThere may be generic object models that are initially accessed based on visual and tactile information that are updated once contact is madewith the object. Davidson and Wolpert (2004) have shown that people can form internal models of two objects of varying weight, but identicalappearance, and repeatedly switch between them as they grasp and lift one of the objects. Moreover, people can additively combine thesemodels to preprogram the forces required to lift a single, combined (stacked) object.\nIn summary, the grip forces produced when lifting an object in the hand are precisely coordinated in space and time and are of suf \ufb01cient\nmagnitude to prevent the object from slipping between the \ufb01ngers.

The categories of\nskilled movements considered to be non-prehensile are shown in table 7.1, together with the types of manual activity subsumed under eachclass.\nGestures and Signs\nStudies of gesture have focused on variables such as the temporal relation between gesticulatory movements and speech phrases, therepertoires of codi \ufb01ed gestures (often referred to as quotable gestures) in different speaker communities, and the differences between cultural\ngroups in their use of gestures (Kendon, 1993). When the use of speech is limited due to environmental conditions (e.g., the noisy work\nenvironment of a sawmill [Meissner & Philpott, 1975]) or restricted because of cultural or religious reasons (silence required during periods ofmourning or in monastic religious orders), quotable gestures are often used in place of speech and have properties similar to those of spokenlanguage.\nThe gesture systems that have arisen as substitutes for speech within environments in which there is no direct access to spoken languages, such\nas in deaf communities, are as elaborate as spoken languages and structurally analogous (Klima & Bellugi, 1979). These gestures are differentfrom the gesticulations that are used to supplement or illustrate the spoken word, and so are commonly referred to as signs. Monastic sign\nlanguages (Umiker-Sebeok & Sebeok, 1987) and sign language systems that are developed as alternatives to speech by people who have full\nand normal access to speech, such as Australian aboriginal women in mourning, share many similarities to the sign languages used in deaf\ncommunities. Comparable to quotable gestures, signs have a speci \ufb01ed form, and variations in the shape of the hand, movement of the hand,\nlocation of the hand in space, and palm orientation can all be used to convey morphology and syntax.

Unlike spoken languages, they have tended to\ndevelop in isolation from one another, and so even sign languages that are used in English-speaking countries, such as the United States (ASL)and the United Kingdom (BSL), are quite different from each other (Deuchar, 1999).

The\ndistinction between these two types of movement is based on the end point of the movement trajectory. Pointing movements are made by thehand and arm toward a visually or proprioceptively de \ufb01ned target, but contact is not usually made with the target. When \ufb01ngertip contact is\nmade with the target, the accuracy of pointing movements improves (Rao & Gordon, 2001). Aiming movements do involve contact with atarget and are therefore more spatially constrained in terms of endpoint accuracy. The contact with the target can be with the \ufb01ngers or with a\nstylus held in the hand. When studied experimentally, aiming movements are usually produced repetitively toward one or more target\npositions. Both of these types of movement are considered to be non-prehensile because the objective of the task is to transport the hand to a\nde\ufb01ned spatiall ocation. In contrast to reaching-to-grasp movements, the position and forces produced by the \ufb01ngers and wrist do not have to\nbe explicitly controlled in aiming and pointing movements. Nevertheless, there are many similarities in reaching and pointing movements interms of the kinematics of the movements and the factors that in \ufb02uence movement time and accuracy.\nPointing Movements\nPointing movements have been studied from a variety of perspectives, ranging from analyses of the kinematics of the movements and the\nconditions under which these change (Atkeson & Hollerbach, 1985; Morasso, 1981) to studies of the errors made in pointing and what thesesuggest about the computational processes involved in planning movements (Soechting, Tillery, & Flanders, 1990). There has also been a\nconsiderable amount of research conducted on whether movement amplitude or \ufb01nal position is the controlled variable in pointing\nmovements (e.g., Bock & Eckmiller, 1986: Feldman, 1974; Kelso, 1977) and on how kinesthetic cues are used to encode these movements(Adamovich, Berkinblit, Fookson, & Poizner, 1998).\nThe kinematics of pointing movements have been studied in detail, and the characteristic features of the velocity pro \ufb01les have been described.\nFor both single-joint and multijoint pointing movements in which the constraints on spatial accuracy are low , the velocity pro \ufb01le of the wrist's\nmovement is bell-shaped and has a single peak, as shown in \ufb01gure 7.2 (Morasso, 1981; Soechting, 1984). As the amplitude of the movement\nincreases, so too does the peak velocity , which means that movement time remains essentially constant (Georgopoulos, 1986). If the accuracy\nrequirements of the pointing task become stringent, the velocity pro \ufb01le becomes segmented, which re \ufb02ects the \ufb01ne positioning movements\nmade by the hand as it approaches the target.\nWhen the arm is moved in the sagittal plane toward a target, the path of the hand is usually slightly curved (Soechting & Lacquaniti, 1981),\nwith the extent of curvature varying with movement\nFigure 7.2.

This curvature in the hand's trajectory is not affected by the speed of the movement nor\nby the addition of large loads (Lacquaniti & Soechting, 1982: Lacquaniti, Soechting, & Terzuolo, 1982). The curvature does, however, increase\nwhen movements are made in the absence of visual feedback of the limb and target (Sergio & Scott, 1998). It is also in \ufb02uenced by the visual\nexperience of the individual, as blind people follow much straighter paths than do blindfolded sighted people (Miall & Haggard, 1995; Sergio& Scott, 1998). Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for the curvature of voluntary arm movements, one of which proposes thatthe trajectory is selected so that it optimizes control variables related to the dynamics of arm movement and minimizes the changes in torqueproducing the movement (Hollerbach & Atkeson, 1986; Uno, Kawato, & Suzuki, 1989). In this model, known as the minimum torque changemodel, the arm follows a trajectory planned in intrinsic (joint and muscle) coordinates. The alternate hypothesis, the minimum jerk model,\nargues that movements are planned in extrinsic coordinates and that the desired path is straight but deviations occur due to inaccuracy in the\ncontroller, visual misperception of straight lines, and unavoidable errors (Flash & Hogan, 1985). The differences in the movement trajectoriesof blind-folded sighted and blind participants (Miall & Haggard, 1995) indicate that visual experience does affect the spatial path of the handduring pointing movements and that trajectory planning is not limited to simply minimizing some dynamic function.\nWhen pointing to a target, information about the location of the target is provided by the visual system whereas proprioceptors in muscles\nsignalthe initialpositions of the hand and arm. The sensory signal s that specify target l ocation have to be transformed into motor commands,\nwhich are sent to motor neurons controlling arm muscles, and so there needs to be a common frame of reference for the visual (extrinsic) and\nproprioceptive (intrinsic) coordinate systems. Based on their analyses of pointing errors to remembered visual targets in three-dimensional\nspace, Flanders and Soechting (1990) proposed that two separate channels are involved in this visual-proprioceptive transformation; \ufb01rst, arm\nelevation is computed from target distance and elevation, and second, arm yaw is calculated from target azimuth. They argue that the preferredcoordinate system for controlling the kinematics of the arm is centered on the shoulder and not the head, because most of the errors inpointing were with respect to the distance that the arm had to be moved and not the direction of the movement (Flanders, Helms Tillery, &Soechting, 1992). This hypothesis was based on the consistency of the errors when they were evaluated using a spherical coordinate systemthat was centered on the shoulder. In these experiments, participants moved their hand, which was resting at their side, to the rememberedtarget location either in the dark or with the lights on. It is not clear to what extent the interpretation of these results can be generalized toother, more natural, pointing tasks in which the initial position of the hand varies and the target is visible. The movement errors that provide\nthe basis for this modelof sensorimotor transformations are not seen under normalconditions when both the hand and the target are visibl e.\nUnder these conditions, it would appear that the position of the hand in space, rather than the orientation of the arm, is more critical foraccurately locating the visually de \ufb01ned target position.\nPointing movements can also be made in the absence of any visual feedback, and in this context the contribution of proprioceptive cues to the\nencoding of movements has been studied, together with an analysis of how the conditions under which these cues become", "doc_id": "248afecf-2187-417c-b7b8-b7835f178802", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "84c02dc6ab7665b7fb39dab344f0cce44057db89956a14c2e444027f9935aaf4", "extra_info": {"page_label": "128", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3933}, "relationships": {"1": "0719bc99-798e-45f5-a189-601cdc45b4de", "3": "7c2c0024-dd44-4a58-9109-75fd6ad7da59"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c2c0024-dd44-4a58-9109-75fd6ad7da59": {"__data__": {"text": "or with the lights on.

In these experiments, participants moved their arm actively to a target location or the arm was guided passively by theexperimenter or a robotic arm. The person was then required either to move the arm to the same location after it was returned to the originalor to a different starting position or to move the opposite arm to the same location as the target limb.

The pattern of errors that they observed\nwas, however, similar to those reported when pointing to visual targets, suggesting that the errors re \ufb02ect the mechanisms by which space is\nrepresented internally and are not modality speci \ufb01c.\nAiming Movements\nGoal-directed aiming movements have been studied for more than a century, ever since Woodworth (1899) \ufb01rst proposed that there are two\ncomponents to these movements: a ballistic movement that covers most of the distance, which he termed the initial impulse, followed by adeceleration phase to the \ufb01nal goal position that is under visual feedback control, called current control. The experiments that Wood-worth\nconducted required that participants make back-and-forth horizontalsl iding movements with a pencilon paper that was attached to a drum\nrotating orthogonally to the pencil's movement. Of particular interest to Woodworth was the contribution of vision to current or feedback\ncontrol. This was studied by measuring movement accuracy with the eyes open and closed during movements of varying speed. Hedetermined that at movement times of approximately 450 ms, there was no difference between the errors obtained in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Subsequent studies of discrete aiming movements, not reciprocal movements as Woodworth used, have shown that the timerequired for the visual feedback loop to operate is considerably shorter than Wood-worth's estimate and is probably between 100 and 200 ms(Keele & Posner, 1968, Zelaznik, Hawkins, & Kisselburgh, 1983). Even for very rapid movements, visual feedback of the arm and targetenhances movement accuracy, particularly during the last 25% of the movement trajectory (Elliott, Helsen, & Chua, 2001).\nSince the 1950s, reciprocal aiming movements have been extensively studied using a task in which a person holds a stylus in the hand and\nmoves it rapidly between two target positions, as shown in \ufb01gure 7.3. Typically, the size of the targets and the distance between them are\nvaried, and measurements are made of movement time and sometimes the trajectory of the movements (Jagacinski, Repperger, Moran, Ward,& Glass, 1980; Langolf, Chaf \ufb01n, & Foulke, 1976). In 1954, Fitts suggested that the degree of precision required to execute such a movement\nwas a function of the number of alternative movements that could be made. If a movement is being made to a wide target, then a largenumber of movements are possible, whereas the range of movements is constrained if the target is very small. Similarly, the range of possiblemovements is affected by\nFigure 7.3.

Fitts noted that the time taken to move between two targets depended on the movement\namplitude and the width of the targets and proposed the following equation to predict movement time:\n where MT is\nmovement time, aandbare constants that depend on the individualand the task, respectivel y, Ais movement amplitude, and Wis the target\nwidth.\nThis equation characterizing the speed-accuracy trade-off became known as Fitts' law and has been found to generalize to many types of hand\nand arm movements (Crossman & Goodeve, 1983; Fitts, 1964). The speed with which movements can be performed is a function of theindex of dif \ufb01culty (ID), which is de \ufb01ned as log2 (2A/W ), and so movements with higher indices of dif \ufb01culty take longer to perform, as shown\nin\ufb01gure 7.4. The index weights movement amplitude and target width or tolerance equally, which means that doubling the distance and\nhalving the target width are equivalent (see \ufb01gure 7.4). This implies that the amount of information transmitted by the neuromuscular system\nis constant over time. In a typicalreciprocaltapping task, the information transmission rate has been found to be 10 bits/s (Fitts, 1954). Fitts'law has been found to be a good predictor of movement time for a wide variety of precise manipulative motions, including microassembly andpeg transfer tasks performed using a microscope (Langolf et al., 1976). However, it does not predict accurately the movement times in shortmovements (Klapp, 1975), nor in bimanual tasks in which the hands move to targets of very different widths (i.e., discrepant indices ofdif\ufb01culty). Under these conditions, the arm movements are synchronized so that the hands arrive at the targets simultaneously, as shown in\n\ufb01gure 7.5 (Kelso, Southard, & Goodman, 1979).\nAnalyses of the movements made during reciprocal tapping tasks indicate that the increase in movement time with increases in ID occurs in\nthe terminalphase of the movement, where feedback controlis assumed to be important (Carl ton, 1979). This is re \ufb02ected in the velocity\npro\ufb01le, which changes from being relatively symmetric when aiming at large targets to asymmetric for smaller targets. For the latter, more time\nis spent in the deceleration phase of the movement to make corrections as the hand approaches the target (MacKenzie, Marteniuk, Dugas,Liske, & Eickmeir, 1987).\nFurther support for the importance of visualfeedback to movement accuracy in the terminalphase of goal -directed aiming movements comes\nfrom studies in which movements are made with and without vision. When visual feedback of the limb and the target is available, participantsspend proportionately more of the overall movement time in the interval after the peak velocity than when moving in the absence of vision,even though early kinematic markers, such as peak velocity and time to peak velocity, are not affected by the presence or absence of visual\nfeedback (Elliott, Carson, Goodman, & Chua, 1991). In addition, there are usually more discontinuities in the movement trajectory during the\ndeceleration phase in the presence of vision than without (Chua & Elliott, 1993), although this does not always occur (Meyer, Abrams,Kornblum, Wright, & Smith, 1988).

These two tasks share some similarities in that they both involve reaching with the \ufb01ngers to depress a sequence of\nkeys, but they differ in severalimportant dimensions. With piano pl aying, there is a rhythmic requirement to the timing of the key presses,\nwhereas typing has no such restrictions, other than that the keys are struck in the correct order. In addition, the force with which the keys are\nstruck is not usually regulated when typing, provided it exceeds the key switch actuation or \u201cmake\u201dforce. When playing the piano, the force\napplied to the key and the time that the key remains depressed are actively controlled as they in \ufb02uence the loudness and duration of the\nresulting tone.\nMuch of the research on these complex motor skills has focused on the nature of the internal representation of the task and the translation of\nthis representation into action and so has considered both the cognitive and motor aspects of the skill (Gentner, 1987; C. Palmer, 1997;\nRumelhart & Norman, 1982). For typing, a theoretical model comprising four components of the skill has been proposed: the input stage in\nwhich the text is converted into chunks; a parsing phase in which the chunks are decomposed into strings of characters; a process of\ntranslation in which the characters are converted into movement speci \ufb01cations; and \ufb01nally the execution of these movements (Salthouse,\n1986). It is assumed that these four processing phases can operate simultaneously with each component dealing with different segments ofinformation. The in \ufb02uence of these various stages of processing on typing speed and errors has been studied in numerous experiments in\nwhich the characteristics of the materialbeing typed (e.g., meaningfulversus nonsense words, high-frequency versus l ow-frequency words) andthe amount of preview of the material(i.e., the122 Non-prehensile Skilled Movements", "doc_id": "5122e77e-4dbc-47a7-a335-aecf93c57871", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6b3f23ada1947fc5221c9a74a75fa89962f55e97547c399d6fae6e1f4c5a2ead", "extra_info": {"page_label": "131", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2697}, "relationships": {"1": "01e184e8-5f96-4337-8a3f-d2ac6d33bb4d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "06f32e93-3f36-4964-9e8f-540fe62df175": {"__data__": {"text": "number of visible characters) have been varied (Gentner, 1987; Inhoff, 1991; Salthouse, 1984).\nTo understand these keyboard skills better, some researchers have simpli \ufb01ed the task to eliminate the linguistic (typing words) or musical\n(piano playing) components and have required that participants tap a series of keys in a prescribed order or according to some temporallyde\ufb01ned sequence (Povel & Collard, 1982). On the basis of the latency pro \ufb01les of the participants' tapping responses on this type of task,\nmodels of the internal timekeeper have been proposed (e.g., Shaffer, 1981; Wing & Kristofferson, 1973).\nTyping\nThe\ufb01rst typewriter to achieve commercial success was developed by Sholes and Glidden (Sholes, Glidden, & Soul\u00e9, 1868), and by 1874 it was\nbeing manufactured by the Remington Arms Company. It was a machine devised without empiricalresearch and devel oped in response to the\nlimitations of other machines, whose keys tended to jam at moderate typing speeds. It was originally designed for \u201chunt and peck \u201doperation\nand not for touch typing; the performance objective in terms of speed was to make a machine that could print words at a speed equivalent tohandwriting (Noyes, 1983). It achieved success while many other rivals failed, in part because it had an excellent system for productimprovement, with as many as 30 models coming out over 4 years (Tenner, 2004). The QWERTY keyboard had become the internationalstandard by 1905, and despite criticisms over the years as to its suboptimall ayout and the excessive use of the weaker \ufb01ngers, alternative\nkeyboards have met with little commercial success (Dvorak, 1943; Noyes, 1983). It has been characterized as one of the most maladaptivehumanmachine interfaces ever invented (Salthouse, 1984).\nTyping is a motor skill that requires explicit training to acquire expertise, that takes a relatively long time to become an expert, but that once\nacquired is resilient to loss (Salthouse, 1984). Touch typists are trained to type in a prescribed manner, with the \u201chome position \u201dfor each\n\ufb01nger de \ufb01ning a standard initialposture of the hands. Each l etter of the keyboard is typed with a particul ar \ufb01nger, which returns to its home\nposition after the letter is typed. A keystroke to type a single letter therefore involves three components: moving the \ufb01nger from its home\nposition to a position over the target key, depressing the key with suf \ufb01cient force to register the letter, and then returning to the home position.\nIt has been estimated that over a 10-year period a typical professional typist types more than 25 million words at an average rate of 60 words/min (wpm), which corresponds to an average of 5 keystrokes/s. Very fast professionaltypists can maintain a typing speed of more than 9keystrokes/s for up to an hour (Gentner, 1988).\nWhen the performance of expert and novice typists is compared, the most obvious differences are that experts type faster, 60 \u2013120 wpm as\ncompared to 13 \u201325 wpm for novices after 4 \u20138 weeks of typing classes, and have much lower error rates. The interval between successive\nkeystrokes is shorter in experts as compared to novices (see \ufb01gure 7.6), and the average speed of the \ufb01nger movements of expert\nFigure 7.6.

This continuous, \ufb02uid motion of the \ufb01ngers in skilled typists\nstands in contrast to the awkward hunt-and-peck methods of the unskilled typist, in which each keystroke is made in sequence.\nPiano Playing\nThe musicalkeyboard has existed for more than 500 years and has its beginnings in ancient organs, which were pl ayed with open hands or\ufb01sts, but not with individual \ufb01ngers. From these origins came the great medievalorgans with keys instead of sl iding horizontalbars,\nclavichords in which the keys actuated brass surfaces that made contact with metallic strings, and harpsichords in which the strings were\nplucked by quills held by wooden bars that were actuated by the keys (Tenner, 2004). However, it was not until the mid-18th century that\nkeyboard technique underwent a major innovation when C. P . E. Bach proposed a \ufb01ngering system with an emphasis on the use of the thumb\nas a pivot. Since that time, there have been numerous attempts to improve the design and construction of the piano, some of which wereimmensely successful, such as the cast-iron frame that could support much higher string tensions and was less sensitive to seasonal\ufb02uctuations in temperature and humidity. Other innovations that attempted to overcome de \ufb01ciencies in keyboard layout met with much less\nsuccess. For example, a keyboard was designed in the 1880s by Paul von Janko in which the keys were arranged in staggered tiers of wholetones (similar to the organ keyboard) so that the octave was now six keys wide. This meant that it was easier to play complex passages,particularly for people with smaller hands. The keyboard was criticized, however, for making challenging passages too easy (Tenner, 2004).\nSome of the earliest research on the motoric aspects of piano playing was conducted in the 1930s by Seashore, who attached balsa-wood \ufb01ns\nto the hammers inside the piano and used continually moving \ufb01lm to record the timing and intensity of the hammers' movements (Seashore,\n1938). Analyses of the data he collected from concert pianists playing Beethoven and Chopin revealed that the pianists used considerablevariation in tempo (rubato) in the timing of notes, bars, and phrases, and yet these variations were consistently reproduced in subsequentperformances. More recent studies of piano playing have used a variety of tasks to study musical skill. These include performing unfamiliarmusic from notation (sightreading), performing well-learned music from memory or notation, improvising, and playing by ear (C. Palmer,1997). Performance on these various measures tends to be relatively highly correlated and improves with training (McPherson, 1995).Comparisons of the performances of expert and less-accomplished pianists indicate that expert performance is usually characterized by a\nsuperior ability to reproduce reliably the timing and loudness variations of the musical score in consecutive performances (C. Palmer, 1989).

When typing, there is a considerable anticipatory component to performance, particularly whenconsecutive keystrokes are executed by different hands (Soechting & Flanders, 1992). Skilled typists commit themselves at the motoric level to\ntyping a particular letter approximately three characters in advance of the current keystroke and can visually process up to eight characters in\nadvance of the character being typed (see \ufb01gure 7.7; Salthouse, 1984). The latter \ufb01nding is based on the deterioration in typing performance\nwhen the amount of preview available on a display screen is limited to fewer than eight characters (Shaffer, 1976). Consistent with these\ufb01ndings, recordings of eye movements during transcription typing have shown that skilled typists are typically reading between three to \ufb01ve\ncharacters in advance of where they are typing (Butsch, 1932; Gentner, 1988; Inhoff, Briihl, Bohemier, & Wang, 1992).

It appears that, with\npractice, skilled typists learn to look ahead of the currently typed text and prepare for future keystrokes by positioning their \ufb01ngers over the\nappropriate keys. This interpretation is supported by the \ufb01nding that the greatest difference between novices and experts in typing speed\noccurs when consecutive keystrokes are executed by \ufb01ngers on different hands (Gentner, 1983). When expert typists are prevented from\npreviewing the text that is to be typed, their typing speed becomes similar to that of novice typists (Salthouse, 1984).\nA similar span of preview is evident when pianists reproduce unfamiliar musical sequences. Sloboda (1974) reported that the eye \u2013hand span\nfor sightreading music was between four and seven events beyond the point at which the musicalnotation disappeared from view . As wasnoted for typing, the eye-hand span in pianists was positively correlated with sight-reading ability , as de \ufb01ned by the number of mistakes made\nbefore the musicalscore disappeared from view (Sl oboda, 1974). Using a different task, in which pianists were required to perform brie \ufb02y\ndisplayed musical extracts, Bean (1938) also noted that experienced pianists had a greater \u201cspan of apprehension \u201dthan did novices; that is, they\nplayed more notes correctly . These studies on eye-hand span in pianists and typists indicate that skilled performers are able to look furtherahead in the materialbeing read than are novices and on the basis of this preview make preparatory \ufb01nger movements.\nAn interesting analogue to the eye \u2013hand span in keyboard skills is the ear \u2013hand span reported for telegraphers receiving Morse code (also\nknown as continuous wave, or CW). In their 1899 study of telegraphy, Bryan and Harter observed that expert telegraphers prefer to keep 6 \u201312\nwords behind the transmitting instrument, which means that they have processed in the order of 230 clicks (dots and dashes) before typing thereceived message. In contrast, the beginner \u201cmust take each letter as it comes \u201d(Bryan & Harter, 1899, p. 353) and learn not to guess ahead in\norder to avoid time-consuming errors. With practice, the beginner goes from waiting for letters to words, and after many years of experiencethe processing of these elements becomes almost automatic in the expert telegrapher (Bryan & Harter, 1899). For telegraphy, typing, and pianoplaying, expert performance is associated with being able to remember a longer sequence of letters or notes that are realized in \ufb01nger\nmovements. Independently of whether this sequence is represented as a visual or auditory code, the span is similar: between 6 and 12elements.\nSensory Feedback and Errors in Performance\nTyping errors are usually noted by a typist even when no visual feedback is available and are responded to quite rapidly as re \ufb02ected in the\nincrease in between-keystroke times immediately following an error (Salthouse, 1984). These responses suggest that kinesthetic feedback aboutmovement trajectories is used to evaluate the success of the movement after its execution.

Substitution errors often entailtyping an adjacent key that is either horizontalor verticalto the target key or invol ve a\nmirror-image substitution in which the same \ufb01nger on the opposite hand types the key (Logan, 1999). Analyses of substitution errors indicate\nthat, in many cases, it is not that the trajectory of the \ufb01nger is incorrect, but that the wrong \ufb01nger is executing the keystroke, and so it is an\nerror in \ufb01nger assignment, not \ufb01nger movement (Salthouse, 1986). Intrusion errors often involve very short interkey intervals in the vicinity of\nthe error and appear to result from incorrectly positioning the \ufb01nger above the target key so that two keys are struck by the same keystroke\n(Grudin, 1983). In contrast to these errors, omission errors are often followed by a much longer interkey interval, which is consistent with the\ufb01nding that many of these errors occur because the key was not depressed with suf \ufb01cient force and so did not register. Omission errors occur\nmore frequently for keys that are dif \ufb01cult to reach or that are typed with the little \ufb01ngers (Shaffer, 1975). The majority of transposition errors,\nwhich refer to errors in which two adjacent letters in a word are reversed, occurs across the hands (Shaffer, 1976). These can be accounted for\nby the anticipatory aspect of typing noted above, in which several \ufb01ngers may move simultaneously toward their target keys.\nMusical performance is evaluated in terms of the quality of the interpretation and the consistency of dynamic changes applied across\nsuccessive performances of the same piece (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-R\u00f6mer, 1993; Sloboda, 1984) and not simply in terms of errors.Pianists tend not to correct musicalerrors in performance, as it is considered more important to preserve the rhythm of the piece rather thanthe exact melody (Shaffer, 1981). Nevertheless, error analyses indicate that pitch deletions (missing a note) are more likely to occur within\nphrases (a partition of the musicalsequence), and perseverations (repeating a note) occur at phrase boundaries (C. Pal mer & van de Sande,\n1995). The particular notes played in error often preserve the harmony of the music in skilled pianists and can be corrected extremely rapidly\n(within 66 ms). The speed with which these errors are corrected is considerably shorter than the auditory (140 \u2013160 ms), visual(180 \u2013200 ms),\nand tactile (140 \u2013270 ms) reaction times (Leonard, 1959; Welford, 1980). This suggests that they are detected and a corrective response is\ninitiated as they occur (Shaffer, 1981). The minimum response latency to tactile stimuli in the distal hand muscles in adults is 60 ms (Johansson& Westling, 1987).\nWhen typing requires that two successive keystrokes are made by the same hand, the second keystroke is initiated within 20 ms of the \ufb01rst. If\nalternate hands are used, the movements overlap, and the second keystroke is initiated before the \ufb01rst key press, indicating that tactile\ninformation from the \ufb01ngerpad is not used to cue subsequent movements (Soechting, Gordon, & Engel, 1996). If the \ufb01ngertip of one digit is\nanesthetized so that observers no longer receive tactile input from the \ufb01nger but can still move it, the timing of \ufb01nger movements and the\nexcursion of the \ufb01ngertip are not affected (Gordon & Soechting, 1995; Rabin & Gordon, 2004).

These errors are not usually recognized, and so the typical increase in the interval before the next keystroke normally\nseen after mistyping a letter is not evident when errors are made by the anesthetized \ufb01nger (Gordon & Soechting, 1995). Figure 7.8 shows the\nintervals between keystrokes when typing an error normally and when the \ufb01ngers are anesthetized. If tactile feedback is removed from all\n\ufb01ngers by having participants type above the keyboard without contacting the keys, then there is a substantialdecrease in typing speed and\nsigni\ufb01cant increase in the number of errors (Terzuolo & Viviani, 1980). These \ufb01ndings indicate that tactile afferent feedback from the \ufb01ngertip\nis important for ensuring movement accuracy and for detecting errors during typing, but is not criticalfor maintaining typing rhythm. As\ndescribed in chapter 3, mechanoreceptors in the skin contribute to proprioception (Edin & Abbs, 1991), and in the absence of this sensory\ninput, perception of the initialand \ufb01nalpositions of the \ufb01ngers during typing can be impaired. Errors then increase with successive\nmovements.\nMovement Speed and Keyboard Skills\nFor skilled typists, the interval between successive keystrokes is typically 100 \u2013200 ms (Martin et al., 1996; Terzuolo & Viviani, 1980), but\nintervals as brief as 60 ms are not uncommon (van Galen &126 Non-prehensile Skilled Movements", "doc_id": "85c905cd-1d3d-4dc3-bfb8-6b3c346e911a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1689d62cb691baa294460f00febe6f41816072fe33d1830c89fed9bac4523508", "extra_info": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2923, "end": 4924}, "relationships": {"1": "9cfe99a4-704a-4e8b-9594-71a8e1f82011", "2": "405547ef-a0d2-4452-a5ca-9aee81fa59c7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fe2c4b4-dc53-47ea-b7a1-09a96d926de8": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 7.8.

The interval between successive keystrokes is usually 30 \u201360 ms shorter if the preceding keystroke were made by the opposite\nhand (Salthouse, 1984). When keystrokes are made with \ufb01ngers on the same hand, there is little opportunity to prepare for the next keystroke,\nwhereas with the opposite hand the relevant \ufb01nger can begin to move toward the next key at the same time as the preceding key is being\nstruck, and it does so about 30 ms before the termination of the preceding keystroke (Larochelle, 1984).\nThe standard QWERTY keyboard is generally considered to have a suboptimal layout for touch typing because it overloads the left hand and\nthe little \ufb01ngers of both hands. The arrangement of the keys was dictated more by mechanicalconsiderations, in particul ar avoiding the\nclashing of type bars, rather than facilitating human performance (Dvorak, 1943). There is no evidence, however, that faster keystrokeperformance is achieved with alternative keyboard designs, even though they may be preferred by users (Noyes, 1983). Analyses of the\ncharacteristics of typing by novice and skilled typists indicate that whereas the novice is limited primarily by cognitive constraints (e.g.,processing text, identifying key position, planning \ufb01nger movements), the main constraint affecting skilled typists' performance is motoric.\nInterstroke intervals for experts can vary by a factor of two or more and primarily depend on the keyboard location of the letters and the\ufb01ngers used to type them. The cognitive effects are generally small for skilled typists, and factors such as word frequency have a relatively\nminor in \ufb02uence on experts' typing speed (Gentner, 1988). In addition, there is no relation between typing skill and the degree of\ncomprehension of the material that is being typed (Salthouse, 1984).

However, typing rate does slow as the material to be typed approaches a random sequence of letters (West & Sabban, 1982). Finally, the\nrate at which text is read is generally about four times that with which it can be typed (240 \u2013260 wpm when reading as compared to 50 \u201360\nwpm when typing), and so it is not the input processes that are the limiting factor in maximum typing rates (Salthouse, 1984).\nSending Morse code and playing the piano also involve repetitive \ufb01nger movements, and these can be performed at rates similar to those\nreported for typing (L. A. Jones, 1998). Experienced Morse code operators can send code at the rate of 20 \u201330 wpm (ARRL, 2003); at this\ntransmission rate, the duration of a dit, the short key closure, averages 52 ms (Tan, Durlach, Rabinowitz, Reed, & Santos, 1997). When playingthe piano, accurate temporalcontrolis essentialfor rhythmic performance, which means that the timing for a particul ar note is in \ufb02uenced by\nthe timing of other adjacent and nonadjacent notes (Vorberg & Hambuch, 1978). The speed with which piano keys are played clearly depends\non the timing constraints of the musicalscore, but at faster tempos internote interval s are often 80 \u2013100 ms (MacKenzie & Van Eerd, 1990).\nFor brief periods of time, such as when playing trills, pianists can produce 20 \u201330 successive notes per second (one every 40 ms) with each\nhand (C. Palmer & van de Sande, 1995). To put these response times in the context of re \ufb02ex responses, the most rapid spinalre \ufb02ex in the\nintrinsic hand muscles is around 40 ms (Matthews, 1984), as de \ufb01ned in terms of the onset of stimulation to the mechanical response of the\nmuscle.\nThe similarity in peak movement speeds recorded from expert typists and pianists suggests that they are performing near the mechanical and\nneural limits of the human hand and that the intervals between successive keystrokes are determined mainly by the layout of the keyboard and\nthe physicalconstraints of the \ufb01ngers and hands (Gentner, 1983). A summary of the average and peak interresponse intervals associated with\nthese tasks is given in \ufb01gure 7.9. These times are particularly impressive when compared to choice reaction times. Salthouse (1984) reported\nthat the median interkey intervalfor a group of touch typists that he studied was 177 ms, whereas in a serialtwo-al ternative choice reactiontask, the same individuals had a mean reaction time of 560 ms. The latter is clearly a serial task because no stimulus appears until theoccurrence of the preceding response. The parallel processing that is seen in expert typists, who prepare \ufb01nger movements on each hand in\nadvance, is not possible in the reaction-time task.\nFigure 7.9.

The activation forces for most electronic keyboards are low , typically less than 1 N (August & Weiss, 1992; Rempel, Dennerlein, Mote,& Armstrong, 1994), which is consistent with the recommended upper limit for actuation force of 1.5 N (Martin et al., 1996).

For skilled typists, the forces produced during typing do not vary signi \ufb01cantly across the \ufb01ngers, and the\nmean keystroke force is around 0.9 N (Rempel et al., 1997). The peak keystroke forces are usually much higher than this, and average 2 N(Armstrong, Foulke, Martin, Gerson, & Rempel, 1994; Martin et al., 1996). These forces are highly correlated with the velocity of the \ufb01ngertip\nprior to key contact (Dennerlein, Mote, & Rempel, 1998), but are themselves quite variable, which suggests that during typing, force is a rather\nloosely controlled variable that is programmed simply to exceed the activation force of the key (Martin et al., 1996). When the forces producedby the \ufb01ngers change as a consequence of varying the inertialmass of each \ufb01nger, the average typing rate is unaffected, even with a threefold\nincrease in mass. If only one \ufb01nger is loaded, then the typing rate is affected in some participants (Terzuolo & Viviani, 1980). These \ufb01ndings\nindicate that the implementation of the movement sequence during typing can readily compensate for changes in the mechanical properties of\nthe hand, provided that these are uniform.\nThe force used to depress a piano key has usually been measured in terms of the velocity of the keystroke, which in an acoustic piano\ndetermines the velocity with which the hammer hits the string. In contrast to typing, force is actively controlled by pianists as it determines\nsound intensity and contributes to the dynamics of the performance. Western tonal music represents pitch and duration explicitly in the\nmusical score, but intensity and tone quality are only approximately speci \ufb01ed, and so the performer has considerable freedom in using these\nambiguities to interpret musical content (C. Palmer, 1997). This means that the interpretation of a particular musical piece will vary acrossperformers and that there is no single ideal interpretation. In general, expert pianists apply more force than amateurs when playing the pianoand produce more variability in the forces applied (Krampe & Ericsson, 1996). They also use variations in the force or intensity of the notesplayed by one hand to carry the melody of the music (Shaffer, 1980).\nFinger Tapping\nA non-prehensile motor skill that contains elements of both goal-directed aiming movements and keyboard skills is \ufb01nger tapping. In this basic\nmotor task, the index \ufb01nger repeatedly taps a lever mounted on a microswitch, and the number of taps made in a speci \ufb01ed intervalof time is\nrecorded (Peters, 1981). In some studies, an alternate tapping task has been used in which the left and right index \ufb01ngers alternately tap keys as\nrapidly as possible (Salthouse, 1984). The most common measure of tapping ability is a global rate de \ufb01ned in terms of the average number of\ntaps per unit time (e.g., 10-s trialwith between 5 and 10 repetitions of each trial ).

The latter variables have primarily been the focus of studiesinvestigating the basis of performance differences between the hands (e.g., Peters, 1980), which will be reviewed in chapter 8.\nFinger tapping is often used as a neuropsychological test to assist in determining the laterality of damage to the cerebral cortex (Lansdell &\nDonnelly , 1977), as a test to evaluate performance asymmetries between the hands of normal healthy adults (Todor & Smiley-Oyen, 1987), and\nin developmental studies as a measure of motor skill (Wolff & Hurwitz, 1976). The results from normal healthy adults indicate that in right-\nhanded individuals the right hand taps more rapidly than the left (Todor & Smiley-Oyen, 1987). However, in skilled right-handed typists, thespeed of repetitive tapping is faster with the left hand as compared to their right hand, whichNon-prehensile Skilled Movements 129", "doc_id": "039c6608-0d91-4a6c-b280-01172ad096b1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ca8d38c31a24165f317dc869a3b10e4265b3dd3c9dea4449c32d6a8064aa7a69", "extra_info": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3062, "end": 4779}, "relationships": {"1": "91c7228c-1f41-452d-b90b-2345e9a308e8", "2": "540cc3a9-4539-48b5-89f6-985519fdcf04"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef7a7462-136f-4e05-8886-890beebac6b1": {"__data__": {"text": "suggests that with extensive training (4 \u20135 years), the performance differences between the hands disappear (Provins & Glencross, 1968). It is\nof interest to note in this context that the more skilled the typist, the faster the repetitive tapping rate when measured with one \ufb01nger or with\nalternate-hand tapping (Salthouse, 1984). The mean tapping rates of men are higher than those of women (Dodrill, 1979). The latter differencemay be attributable to hand size, as there is a signi \ufb01cant positive correlation between hand span and \ufb01nger-tapping rate, and when the hands of\nmen and women are matched with respect to size, the performance differences are no longer apparent (Dodrill, 1979).\nBimanual Music Skills\nOne class of non-prehensile skills that has received very little attention from the perspective of understanding human movement control isbimanual music skills; this encompasses playing stringed, wind, or percussion instruments. There have been some biomechanical studies of thepatterns of joint movements involved in bowing different stringed instruments (Turner-Stokes & Reid, 1999) and of the postural changes that\noccur when playing wind instruments (Bejjani & Halpern, 1989). However, this research has primarily been conducted with the objective of\nunderstanding the factors that may contribute to some of the soft tissue and musculoskeletal problems that affect professional musicians (An& Bejjani, 1990).\nProfessional musicians who play stringed instruments have also provided an excellent subject pool for studying the mechanisms of plasticity in\nthe motor and sensory cortices (Elbert et al., 1995; Kim et al., 2004). In this research, the representation of the individual digits has beenmapped in the primary somatosensory areas, and the relation of these maps to musical experience and training has been studied. As describedin chapter 3, Elbert et al. (1995) reported that the representation of the digits of the left hand, which are continuously engaged in \ufb01ngering the\nstrings when playing a violin or cello, is substantially enlarged in the cortices of string players, when compared to that of nonmusicians.\nMoreover, the enlargement of the cortical representation of the digits is related to the extent of their use in violin playing, with the\nrepresentation of the little \ufb01nger showing a greater relative increase in representation than the thumb, which grasps the neck of the violin.\nThese studies have contributed to our understanding of cortical plasticity and should be complemented by further analysis of the manual skillsacquired by expert string players.\nBimanual music skills, like most of the non-prehensile skills described in this chapter, require explicit training to develop expertise, take a long\ntime to become an expert, but once acquired are fairly resilient to loss. There are features that are common to the performances of expertpractitioners of these skills that differentiate their abilities from those of novices. In particular, the ability to plan ahead as the current\nmovement is executed has been noted in expert pianists and typists. This enables them to execute \ufb01nger-movement sequences more rapidly\n(typists) and consistently (pianists). Frequent and regular practice is, however, essential to the retention of these skills, as will be described i n\nchapter 9.130 Non-prehensile Skilled Movements", "doc_id": "ef7a7462-136f-4e05-8886-890beebac6b1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ba4816d81bdebe6ac068ee316dd8782e847200acb47b9a6268218f13fc1340c2", "extra_info": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3356}, "relationships": {"1": "da0dfc75-6cb5-4a21-b226-c8858935f074"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "746ae254-34f5-45fb-b9cf-937a71a47cb8": {"__data__": {"text": "8\nEnd-effector Constraints\nInmedicalpractice,rubber \ufb01ngersandglovesareoccasionallyusedintheexaminationofinternalorgansaswellasinsurgery,whenthereisdangerofinfection.\n\u2026touchingviaanintermediaryoughttomodifythetactualimpression .\nDAVID KATZ, 1925/1989\nThe manner in which the hand makes contact with the environment affects the type of information that can be extracted and the actions that\ncan be performed. It is therefore important to expand our discussion of hand function now to consider the impact of the site and area ofcontact, the number of digits and hands involved, and the use of probes and other intermediate links. We will address each of these end-effector constraints as they relate to the hand-function continuum shown in \ufb01gure 1.1, namely, tactile sensing, active haptic sensing,\nprehension, and non-prehensile skilled activities.\nTactile Sensing and Active Haptic Sensing\nThe nature of the end effectors that are used to contact and explore objects in \ufb02uences cutaneous sensitivity and perception in severalways. In\nthis section, we consider a number of parameters that relate to the end effector(s) selected and to their consequences for human manualperformance. Although the list below is not exhaustive, it addresses those parameters that research has shown to be most critical. These\nparameters are relevant to either tactile sensing and/or active haptic sensing, as we explain in the discussion that follows.\nSite of Contact\nWithin Hand\nBody locus strongly in \ufb02uences both cutaneous sensitivity and resolution. For most \ufb01ngers, pressure sensitivity within the \ufb01nger tends to be\nhighest on the distal phalanx; however, it would be inappropriate to describe the sensitivity ordering as strictly proximodistal, inasmuch as themiddle phalanx is less sensitive than the proximal phalanx (Weinstein, 1962). Vibrotactile sensitivity also varies with the region of the hand thatis stimulated. For frequencies ranging from 0.8 to 400 Hz (L\u00f6fvenberg & Johansson, 1984) or from about 25 to 800 Hz (Verrillo, 1971), a\nproximodistalgradient is observed, with regions on the pal m being l east sensitive and the most distalportion of the \ufb01ngertips being most\nsensitive. Within the hand itself, the dorsal surface is the least sensitive to vibrotactile stimulation (Wilska, 1954).

Absolute thermal sensitivity to warming and cooling at 70 sites on the hand and forearm has been reported for two\nobservers. Johnson et al. (1973) found that the back of the hand, the dorsal hairy skin of the \ufb01ngers, and the thenar eminence (palm) are most\nthermally sensitive, and the \ufb01ngerpads and the palmar pads at the base of the four \ufb01ngers are the least sensitive. Thus, the proximodistal\nordering of glabrous skin in terms of vibrotactile and, to a lesser extent, pressure sensitivity is reversed for thermal sensitivity (see also Steven s\n& Choo, 1998). It is possible that the greater thermal sensitivity on the back (as compared to the glabrous regions) of the hand is due to thefact that dorsal skin is thinner, as noted in chapter 2. Overall, the research indicates that the sensitivity with which individuals can detect staticcontact, vibration, warmth, and cold is markedly in \ufb02uenced by the region of the hand that is stimulated, although the speci \ufb01c pattern of results\ndepends upon the form of stimulation.\nWith respect to the spatial-resolving capacity of the hand, the proximodistal ordering is both clear and consistent: The palm is the least spatially\nacute, followed by the more proximal part of the \ufb01ngers, then by severalsites on the distal \ufb01ngerpads, each progressively closer to the tip of\nthe\ufb01nger (Craig, 1999; Craig & Lyle, 2001; Stevens & Choo, 1996; Vallbo & Johansson, 1978; Weinstein, 1968). As discussed in chapter 4,\nspatial acuity has been measured in terms of two-point touch, point localization, and grating-orientation thresholds. Whereas \ufb01gure 4.7\nhighlights the proximodistal difference in two-point touch thresholds between the palm and the \ufb01ngertips, \ufb01gure 8.1 reveals a proximodistal\ntrend within the index \ufb01nger itself, based on the results of a two-alternative, forced-choice, tactile-orientation discrimination task (Craig, 1999).\nParticipants were required to identify the orientation of gratings (i.e., along versus across) that were presented with a force of 1 N to the right\nindex \ufb01nger at four different sites: on the distal \ufb01ngerpad at 5, 15, and 25 mm from the tip of the \ufb01nger and in the center of the proximal\nphalanx. Spatial resolution was highest at the two sites closest to the \ufb01ngertip, followed by the 25 mm site on the distal pad, and then the most\nproximalsite near the base of the \ufb01nger. In summary, the research indicates that people's ability to resolve \ufb01ne spatial details systematically\nimproves as stimulation is applied to regions of the hand along a proximodistal gradient.\nTo our knowledge, the temporal-resolving capacity of the hand, a topic that was discussed in chapter\nFigure 8.1.

This effect can be simply demonstrated by using each of these \ufb01ngers in turn to explore the surface texture created by the\n\ufb01ngerprint whorls on the thumb (Lederman, 1976). While such differences in roughness perception may be related to differences in spatial\nacuity across the \ufb01ngertips, they may also be the result of other \ufb01ngertip differences, such as callus thickness.\nAlthough there have been relatively few comparisons of sensitivity and resolution across the \ufb01ngers, the small number of studies reviewed in\nthis section indicates that the \ufb01ngers do appear to vary in terms of their ability to resolve spatial details and with respect to the relative\nmagnitude with which surface roughness is judged.

During that period, hand superiorities in cutaneous sensitivity were rarely observed; that is, nosigni\ufb01cant differences were documented between the left and right hands in terms of two-point touch, point-localization, pressure, sharpness,\nvibrotactile, or tickle thresholds.

These differential abilities are not robust, however, as there is good support for\nroughly as many null results as for predicted left- or right-hand superiorities, (p. 221)\nContact Area and Duration\nOn both the thenar eminence and the \ufb01ngerpad of the right middle \ufb01nger, vibrotactile sensitivity increases at the rate of approximately 3 dB\nper doubling of area for frequencies above 40 Hz (Verrillo, 1963). This is attributable to spatial summation. For contactor areas above 1 mm2,\nspatialsummation is greater on the thenar eminence than on the \ufb01ngertip (Gescheider, Bolanowski, Pope, & Verrillo, 2002); however, for very\nsmall contactor areas and for lower frequencies, little spatial summation has been observed. Sherrick and Cholewiak (1986) subsequently notedthat Verrillo (1963) did not partial out the effect of static force. On the basis of the evidence available at that time, they concluded that forvibrotactile stimulation, the spatial summation documented in tests of absolute sensitivity is small, at best. More recently, however, Brisbenet al. (1999) have challenged this conclusion. In their study, observers sensed vibration either by grasping a vibrating cylinder (like the handle ofa tool) or by means of a probe that was mounted on a linear motor with the 1-mm tip glued to the skin to ensure that it followed the sinusoidalmotion of the probe when it was vibrated perpendicular and parallel to the skin surface. Vibrotactile sensitivity for the former was 23% lower\nat 40 Hz and 61% lower at 300 Hz, as compared to the latter condition. These results con \ufb01rm that the area of skin contact and, hence, spatial\nsummation is indeed an important factor in vibrotactile sensitivity, presumably mediated by FA II units.\nTemporal summation of vibrotactile stimulation is affected by contact duration and, in some cases, contact area (e.g., Gescheider, Berryhill,\nVerrillo, & Bolanowski, 1999; Green, 1976; Verrillo, 1968). More speci \ufb01cally, vibrotactile sensitivity grows with increasing stimulus duration or\nnumber of stimuli in a sequence, particularly for higher frequencies and larger-sized contactors. Presumably these effects are also mediated bythe FA II system.\nThe thermal sensitivity of the skin to both warmth and cold is clearly enhanced by both spatial and temporal summation, although we have\nfound no studies that directly involve the hand.

However, when both the thumb and index \ufb01ngerpads are simultaneously used\nto explore a surface actively, the magnitude of roughness perceived with the index \ufb01nger is greater when two \ufb01ngers are stimulated than when\nthe index \ufb01ngerpad is stimulated on its own (Verrillo, Bolanowski, & McGlone, 1999). These results suggest that a perceptual enhancement\neffect occurs due to spatial summation at these sites. Given the strong evidence for spatial summation of thermal stimulation as well, we wouldexpect similar results for thermal sensitivity at threshold and suprathreshold intensity levels as the number of digits stimulated increases. Inaddition, the perceived heaviness that results from a weight being actively lifted by \ufb02exing the distaljoint of a singl e digit increases when an\nadjacent \ufb01nger lifts a weight simultaneously (Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1991,1992).134 End-effector Constraints", "doc_id": "3064fc49-ff71-44a7-a760-48b0c4017960", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c95a731eba6308da0d6cd5ed6b916b831d2fd3e9f44648857cf1d72f685a3e6c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2932, "end": 4687}, "relationships": {"1": "1c595570-7cb2-4354-ac94-3e0d34740ed7", "2": "df518393-c605-4f1f-81d2-2532aaefea47"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d8ee910-002f-4c11-ac24-9f217bf1b1e0": {"__data__": {"text": "Because this occurs for weights that constitute either a relatively small (3 \u20135%) or much larger (20 \u201325%) percentage of the totalmaximal\nvoluntary force, the increase in perceived heaviness seems to operate across a wide range of muscle forces generated by the hand. With respect\nto the tactile processing of spatial characters, however, there is little empirical support for the notion that increasing the cutaneous \ufb01eld of view\nby displaying the information across two adjacent \ufb01ngers improves either the perception of spatial patterns or tactile reading (e.g., Bliss, 1978;\nLappin & Foulke, 1973; Loomis, Klatzky, & Lederman, 1991). This \ufb01nding suggests that, unlike visual processing, passive tactile sensing of\ncharacters is limited to one character at a time. Although both spatial and temporal interaction effects occur, they are greater when patterns arepresented within a single \ufb01nger rather than across two \ufb01ngers of the same hand (Craig, 1983b, 1985). Unlike tactile sensing of geometric\nfeatures, whole-hand haptic exploration produces faster and more accurate identi \ufb01cation of common objects classi \ufb01ed by their geometric\nproperties than does manual exploration that is limited to a single \ufb01nger (Klatzky et al., 1993). Presumably, the decline in performance\nobserved when a single end effector is employed is attributable to the marked reduction in cutaneous and kinesthetic cues during single- \ufb01nger\nexploration.\nIn summary, the research literature reveals important ways in which the number of digits employed in \ufb02uences manualperformance. The\neffects range from those related to simple sensitivity and resolution measures to the more complex interdigital interactions that affect patternperception via tactile sensing and weight perception and object recognition via active haptic sensing.\nUnimanual Versus Bimanual\nIs there any advantage to using two as opposed to only one hand when haptically exploring objects and their surfaces? It is unlikely that both\nhands are necessary, or even helpful, for extracting information about surfaces and the material properties of objects, such as texture,\ncompliance, and thermal characteristics. However, people generally switch from using one to two hands as the size of the object or displayincreases beyond that of a single hand. Clearly, the assessment of weight requires two hands when the object to be lifted is large or relativelyheavy. In addition, both hands can be, and often are, used to explore the shape, symmetry, and size of an object when it is externally stabilized.Research has also documented a two-hand advantage in Braille reading and in tactile pattern-recognition tasks (Craig, 1985; Craig & Xu, 1990;Lappin & Foulke, 1973). Craig (personal communication, June 1991) attributes the two-hand superiority to greater processing \ufb02exibility\nresulting from extra resources for the second hand, which may serve as a separate limited-capacity processor. Note that these tasks may beperformed using only the cutaneous inputs produced by the pattern being moved across passive \ufb01ngers.\nWhen the objects are \ufb01xed in place, it is possible for people to use either one or two hands actively to detect the presence of symmetry.

Active haptic perception may invol ve\ndirect contact with or without movement of the hand. When there is no movement, the mechanicaland thermalinputs that are avail abl eduring tactile sensing are available; however, when observers voluntarily move their hand(s) over an object or surface, additional kinesthetic\nfeedback and information from corollary discharges become available.\nActive haptic perception is also achieved through indirect contact by means of some intermediate link (e.g., 1-degree-of-freedom thimbles and\nprobes and multidegree-of-freedom handles and grippers). Such tools, if not arti \ufb01cially augmented with force feedback (see chapter 10), offer\nonly reduced tactile (i.e., static net forces and vibratory signals) and kinesthetic feedback.\nIn chapter 5, we emphasized the importance of manual exploration for haptic perception. We also brie \ufb02y alluded to signi \ufb01cant consequences\nfor haptic object recognition when manual exploration is constrained. We consider this issue now in greater detail. Lederman and Klatzky(2004) compared the effects of imposing \ufb01ve different constraints on the haptic recognition of common objects that were de \ufb01ned primarily by\ntheir geometric features. Of the \ufb01ve constraints, three direct-touch constraints were initially considered by Klatzky et al. (1993): limiting the\nnumber of end effectors during exploration, wearing a thick compliant \ufb01nger cover, and splinting the end effector(s). Lederman and Klatzky\n(2004) subsequently imposed two additional constraints that both involved remote haptic exploration: wearing a rigid \ufb01nger cover and using a\nrigid probe. In table 8.1, we consider the \ufb01ve constraints in terms of how each differentially restricts the normally available tactile, thermal, and\nkinesthetic inputs. Figure 8.3 shows the effects of these constraints, singly and in speci \ufb01c combinations, on the accuracy and speed with which\ncommon objects were recognized in these two studies.\nReducing the number of end effectors from \ufb01ve\ufb01ngers to one \ufb01nger (constraint 1) impaired accuracy only a little but increased response time\nsubstantially, presumably because of the need for sequential exploration. The effect of this constraint was to eliminate distributed tactile spati al\ninputs across multiple end effectors and to reduce kinesthetic spatial and temporal cues (see also Jansson & Monaci, 2004).

In this case, the\nimpairments can be attributed to one or more of the following factors: elimination of spatially distributed force patterns on the skin (i.e.,single-point force information), elimination of thermal cues, and the need to integrate and remember kinesthetic spatial information viasequential point contacts. Finally, we note that imposing multiple simultaneous constraints on manual exploration clearly impaired the accuracyand/or speed with which common objects were recognized compared to any single-constraint condition. The implications of constrainingmanual exploration are explored further in chapter 10, where we focus on more applied issues.\nLast, we address a form of remote sensing that Turvey (e.g., 1996) has described as dynamic touch. As explained in chapter 5, this mode of\nperceptual exploration involves the use of a rod held statically in the hand or wielded for purposes of learning about the properties of objects(e.g., length, orientation, weight, and the position of the hand relative to the object). Such a form of sensing is thus speci \ufb01cally dependent on\nsensory inputs arising from the kinesthetic system. While kinesthetic feedback is undoubtedly required for tool manipulation and remotehaptic sensing, such an approach is necessarily limited by the fact that it does not take into consideration the valuable contribution of thecutaneous inputs (e.g., vibration) produced when the hand grasps and manipulates the tool in contact with the concrete environment (see\nBrisben et al., 1999; Johansson & Westling, 1984).\nPrehension\nMost prehensile activities involve grasping an object in the hand, and so the properties of the object (e.g., size, weight, texture, and shape) and\nthe task objective usually determine how the object is held, the area of contact between the object and the hand, and the number of digits\ninvolved in the grasp. These will often change during the course of an activity in which the hand may switch from one posture to another inorder to accomplish the task, such as picking up a pen and then writing. Detailed electromyographic studies of muscle activation duringdifferent tasks indicate that there are marked shifts in the patterns of muscle use as the hand changes from one grasp pattern to another (Long,Conrad, Hall, & Furler, 1970).\nSite of Contact\nThere have been numerous attempts to develop clas-si \ufb01catory systems that characterize the diverse range of postures that the hand adopts to\nperform different tasks (e.g., Cutkosky & Howe, 1990; Elliot & Connolly, 1984; MacKenzie & Iberall, 1994; Napier, 1956). In general, the\nposture of the hand determines the \ufb01ngers that are used to make contact with the object and hence the site of contact. Most of these\ntaxonomies distinguish between the two dominant prehensile postures, that is, the power grip and the precision grip, each of which may takeseveralforms, as shown in Figure 8.4. The power grip is used when force is the primary objective, such as when using a hammer. In this gripthere is usually a large area of contact between the grasped object and the palmar surfaces of the \ufb01ngers and palm, but little movement of the\n\ufb01ngers; hence the grasp is stable and very resistant to slipping.

Swanson, De Groot Swanson, and G\u00f6ran-\nHagert (1990) estimated that a pinch force of 10 N is suf \ufb01cient for performing most of the simple grasping tasks involving the \ufb01ngers. At very\nlow forces, the \ufb01ngertip contact area increases sharply with increasing normal force, but by 1 N it is almost 70% of the contact area at 5 N\n(Serina et al., 1997), as described in chapter 2 and shown in Figure 2.10. This means that if a normal force of 1 \u20132 N at the \ufb01ngertips is\nadequate to maintain stable contact between the \ufb01ngers and an object, there is little additional tactile information available at higher forces as\nthe increase in contact area is small.\nIf the hand does not have to support the object, then the \ufb01nger forces used to explore an object depend on the property being perceived, as\nillustrated in Figure 8.6. The contact forces used by people to estimate the roughness of raised-dot surfaces range from 0.8 to 1.6 N with an\naverage of 1 N (Lederman, 1974; Meftah, Belingard, & Chapman, 2000), whereas the forces applied when vertically pressing the \ufb01nger against\na surface to perceive its temperature have been found to vary from 0.5 to 2 N, with an average of 1.5 N (Ino et al., 1993; L. A. Jones & Berris,2003). Much lower forces are used when people are asked to rate the surface friction of macro-scopically smooth, \ufb02at surfaces (0.2 \u20130.3 N;\nSmith & Scott, 1996) or to \ufb01nd a small feature in an otherwise \ufb02at surface (0.5 N; Smith, Gosselin, & Houde, 2002).\nIn addition to the power and precision grips, a number of other grips are used, which are generally described in terms of the posture of the\nhand (i.e., hook grip, interdigital grip, pliers grasp) or the shape of the object being held (e.g., cylindrical grasp, spherical grasp). Some of thes e\ngrasps, such as the hook grip used to hold a suitcase and the platform grasp that a waiter may use to hold a tray, are non-prehensile as the\nhand is primarily providing support for an object. Because the hand usually adopts different grasps during the performance of a task, it has\nbeen dif \ufb01cult to develop taxonomies of hand function that can predict hand grasps from a speci \ufb01cation of the task requirements and object\ngeometry. It has been possible to predict the general types of grasps used to hold tools when performing speci \ufb01c actions, but these are highly\ndependent on the actions being performed and so are not applicable generally (Cutkosky, 1989).\nA number of studies have addressed the issue of whether the selection of a speci \ufb01c hand con \ufb01guration\nFigure 8.6.

Arbib et al. (1985) proposed the concept of virtual \ufb01ngers to describe\nthe con \ufb01guration of the \ufb01ngers as they apply forces to a handheld object. On one side, there is the thumb or palm of the hand and, on the\nother, a virtual \ufb01nger that may be made up of one or more \ufb01ngers that act in synchrony and are controlled as a unit. These two virtual \ufb01ngers\nthen interact with the object through an opposition space, which occurs between two hand sites that are de \ufb01ned in relation to a coordinate\nframe placed on the palm. The theory of virtual \ufb01ngers provides a usefulframework for cl assifying how objects are grasped and for\nconsidering how to control robotic hands (Iberall, 1997).\nAlthough the concept was originally developed to describe the kinematic aspects of grasping (Iberall & MacKenzie, 1990), a number of\nexperiments have supported the generalconcept of virtual \ufb01ngers in terms of digit force control. For example, Baud-Bovy and Soechting\n(2001) found that the three- \ufb01ngered tripod grasp can be viewed as a two-virtual- \ufb01nger grasp involving one opposition axis. In their\nexperiment, the sum of the index and middle \ufb01nger forces always acted in the same direction independently of the orientation of the contact\nsurfaces, and so the index and middle \ufb01ngers could be replaced by a single virtual \ufb01nger placed midway between the two real \ufb01ngers. Using a\ndifferent \ufb01ve-digit apparatus, Zatsiorsky, Gao, and Latash (2003) observed that the forces generated by four \ufb01ngers combined (i.e., the virtual\n\ufb01nger) were equalto that produced by the thumb. This scal ing of \ufb01nger forces was maintained independently of the torques being generated\nand the geometry of the object being grasped.\nNumber of Digits\nThe primary contributor to the versatility of the human hand is the opposable thumb, which is essential for the effective handling and\nexploration of small objects. Opposition of the thumb involves \ufb02exion, abduction, and medialrotation about the saddl e joint between the\ntrapezium and the \ufb01rst metacarpal, so that the surface on the thumb pad can make contact with the terminal phalanges of one or a number of\nother digits. The extensive area of contact between the \ufb01ngerpads of the thumb and index \ufb01nger is a uniquely human characteristic. It is\nimportant to remember, however, that it is the development and elaboration of the central nervous system and not the specialization of thehand that provides the substrate for human manualskil l(Lemon, 1999).\nIt is estimated that there is a 40% loss in the functional capacity of the hand following amputation of the thumb (Reid, 1960; Swanson, 1964).\nThis estimate is surprisingly close to King Canute's rate of compensation for the loss of a thumb in the 11th century, which was 30 solidi,representing 36% of the total amount allocated for loss of all of the \ufb01ngers (Bertelsen & Capener, 1960; Napier, 1993). In King Canute's time,\nrates of compensation for the loss of digits were well established as they had been decreed in the 7th century by the \ufb01rst Anglo-Danish king of\nKent, Aethelberht. At that time, the thumb was given the same value as all of the other \ufb01ngers together.

This procedurewas\ufb01rst attempted in 1897, with only limited success, by Nicoladoni, who transferred the second toe to the hand of a 5-year-old boy.\nAmputation of either the index or middle \ufb01nger is considered to result in a 20% loss of hand function, whereas the functional capacity of the\nhand is reduced by only 10% when either the ring or little \ufb01nger is amputated (Swanson, 1964). These ratings of functionall oss are consistent\nwith the observation that most manualtasks can be accompl ished using three or four \ufb01ngers, provided that one of these digits is the thumb.\nThe three- or four- \ufb01ngered hand is also the preferred design for most dexterous robotic hands that are capable of performing a variety of\nskilled tasks (L. A. Jones, 1997). From a robotic viewpoint, three \ufb01ngers are the minimum required for a stable grasp by a manipulator (Brock,\n1993; Howard & Kumar, 1996).\nThe grasp used to hold an object depends on the size and shape of the object and the intended use. When reaching for objects of varying size,\npeople tend to use a three- \ufb01ngered grasp, such as the tripod grasp, to pick them up and occasionally use a pinch grip for smaller objects. The\nsize of the object does not affect the \ufb01nalspatialposition of the thumb on the object but does in \ufb02uence the position of the other two digits\ninvolved in the grasp, which suggests that the control of these two digits changes with object size (Gentilucci et al., 2003). As the size and massof the object increase, four rather than three digits are used to pick it up. These transitions from three to four \ufb01ngers and then from one to two\nhands can be predicted from the mass and length of both the object and the hand reaching to grasp it (Cesari & Newell, 2000).\nStudies of the coordination of \ufb01nger forces during prehensile grasping with three, four, or \ufb01ve digits revealthat as object weight increases or\nsurface friction decreases, the largest change in force comes from the index \ufb01nger. Kinoshita, Kawai, and Ikuta (1995) reported that the\npercentage contributions of individual \ufb01nger force to total grip force for the index, middle, ring, and little \ufb01ngers were 42%, 27%, 18%, and\n13%, respectively , and that these percentages remained relatively constant as the weight of an object increased from 200 to 800 g. In absoluteterms, this means that the heavier the weight being lifted, the larger the index and middle \ufb01ngers' contributions to grip force. As the grip mode\nchanged from \ufb01ve to four to three \ufb01ngers, the totalgrip force increased, but the force contributed by the index \ufb01nger remained constant at\naround 43%, and so the forces produced by the ring and middle \ufb01ngers increased. Finger forces also changed with the grasping surface, as has\nbeen described previously (Johansson & Westling, 1984), with the total grip force for a sandpaper surface being about 60% of that for plastic,\nwhich has a much lower surface friction.

In all of these studies, the force produced by the thumb was equal to the sum of theopposing \ufb01nger forces.\nThese \ufb01ndings suggest that the controlof individual \ufb01nger forces during grasping is achieved using a relatively simple scaling strategy that\nmaintains constant the relative contributions of various \ufb01ngers to totalgrip force. This strategy simpl i \ufb01es force controlin a task having many\ndegrees of freedom by creating \ufb01xed relations between the forces produced at the \ufb01ngertips, as shown in Figure 8.7, where the contribution of\neach\ufb01nger to the total grip force and load force in the static phase of grasping is illustrated (Reilmann, Gordon, & Henningsen, 2001). As the\ncontact area with an object decreases, due to a reduction in the number of digits involved in lifting, the grip force increases, which suggests thata larger contact area across the \ufb01ngers may facilitate the \ufb01ne adjustment of \ufb01nger forces. The particular contribution of individual \ufb01nger forces\nto the totalgrip force can, however, change under some conditions. For exampl e, with heavier objects weighing 2 kg or more, it has beenfound that the middle \ufb01nger produces the largest force followed in descending order by the index, ring, and little \ufb01ngers (Radwin, Oh, Jensen,\n& Webster, 1992).

As the number of \ufb01ngers used to grasp the\ncylindrical object increases from two to \ufb01ve, the totalgrip force decreases by 30% (Kinoshita, Murase, & Bandou, 1996). This may resul t from\na reduction in the safety margins employed at each \ufb01nger due to the increased stability of the grip, or it may re \ufb02ect the increased surface\ncontact area with the object, which should facilitate force control.\nWhen an object is grasped, lifted, and held with the whole hand, the time course of the forces produced by the \ufb01ngers is similar to that\ndescribed for grasping movements involving the thumb and index \ufb01nger (see chapter 6). Santello and Soechting (2000) found that the normal\nforces produced by the \ufb01ngers co-varied and that the forces exerted by each \ufb01nger depended on the location of the object's center of mass.\nWhen the object was held in a stable position, the \ufb02uctuations in force, although small, were highly synchronized across the hand.\nBimanual Grasping\nMany prehensile activities require that one hand stabilize the object while the other, usually the preferred hand, manipulates it. For most of\nthese tasks, the coordination is primarily constrained by the physical properties of the object and the task objective. There is both temporal and\nspatialcoordination of the hands to achieve these task goal s, so that a disruption in the capacity of one hand to execute part of a movementsequence is readily compensated for in the timing of the movements of the other hand (Wiesendanger, Kazennikov, Perrig, & Kaluzny, 1996).\nThere is also anticipatory control during activities that require bimanual coordination. In a task involving dropping a ball with one hand into a\nreceptacle held by the other, Johansson and Westling (1988) reported that there was an increase in prehensile forces 150 ms prior to the impactof the ball and that the receptacle was raised to meet the impact of the ball. These anticipatory actions are precisely timed, do not depend onvisual feedback, and are scaled to meet the dynamics of the task (i.e., weight of the ball and distance it is dropped). Moreover, informationobtained by one hand (the hand holding the ball) is available to the other hand so that appropriate adjustments in grip force can be made.\nSome bimanual tasks, such as juggling, have very precise spatial, temporal, and physical constraints, with even the smallest variation in the\nperformance of the two hands leading to errors and collisions between the objects juggled (Beek & Lewbel, 1995).

The performance of intermediate and expert\njugglers can be distinguished on the basis of variability in spatial variables, such as the angle of release and the width of the elliptical hand\nloops, and not temporal variables, such as the height and velocity of the release of the ball (van Santvoord & Beek, 1996).\nHaptic and visual information about the movements of the hands and balls is required for successful juggling, but expert performers appear to\ndepend more on the sensations associated with contact between the hands and balls than do novice or intermediate jugglers, who relypredominantly on visual feedback (Beek & Lewbel, 1995). With extensive practice, it appears that the sight of the moving ball has calibratedthe tactile and proprioceptive senses so that slight deviations in the angle or velocity of release can be detected from haptic feedback. Thiswould account for the performance of expert jugglers who are capable of juggling for several minutes when blindfolded.\nRemote Versus Direct Action\nPrehensile activities involving object manipulation frequently involve the use of tools, and so the sensory information available to the humanoperator is limited by the physical dimensions of the tool and whether it is a passive tool, such as a screwdriver, or an active system, like apower drill. Many of these tasks involve stabilizing an object, such as a screw or piece of wood, with one hand, while the other hand holds thetooland appl ies force through the toolto the object. The neuromuscul ar controlsystem readil y adapts to the changes in the dynamics of thehand and the tool, so that the tool is treated as an extension of the limb in both a physical and perceptual sense, a point made by thephilosopher Michael Polanyi:\nOur subsidiary awareness of tools and probes can be regarded now as the act of making them form a part of our own body. The way we\nuse a hammer or a blind man uses his stick, shows in fact that in both cases we shift outwards the points at which we make contact with\nthe things that we observe as objects outside ourselves. While we rely on a tool or probe, these are not handled as external objects.(Polanyi, 1958, p. 59)\nThis incorporation of an externalobject into the perceptualmap of the human body, often referred to as the body schema, is described in\ncountless contexts from playing a musical instrument to driving a backhoe (Wilson, 1998). The integration of the body with a tool hasdemonstrated neural correlates as shown by functional brain mapping (Obayashi et al., 2001) and neuronal recording studies (Iriki, Tanaka, &\nIwamura, 1996) in monkeys.

As described in chapter 3, the corticalrepresentation of the body is dynamic, not static, and it appears that externalobjects such as tools can be incorporated into these cortical maps.\nNon-prehensile Skilled Movements\nHow Independent Are the Fingers?\nMost muscles controlling movements of the \ufb01ngers and wrist act over many joints, and so the forces and movements produced by these\nmuscles are not controlled independently, and coactivation is common (Schieber & Santello, 2004). The inability to \ufb02ex a single distal joint in\nthe hand without also moving adjacent digits is often observed when playing the piano or typing (Fish & Soechting, 1992). It re \ufb02ects both\nneural factors related to the recruitment of multidigit motor units in extrinsic hand muscles and to mechanical linkages between anatomically\ndistinct muscles and portions of muscles with several tendons (Kilbreath, Gorman, Raymond, & Gandevia, 2002). As described in chapter 2,three of the extrinsic muscles in the forearm, the \ufb02exor digitorum profundus, \ufb02exor digitorum super \ufb01cialis, and extensor digitorum\ncommunis, connect to each of the four \ufb01ngers, and within these muscles there are multidigit motor units (Kilbreath & Gandevia, 1994; Reilly\n& Schieber, 2003). The degree to which each of these muscles can produce force and movement in an isolated \ufb01nger depends on the extent of\ncompartmentalization within the muscle. The limitations imposed by these mechanical linkages is perhaps best illustrated by the 19th-century\nsurgicalpractice of dividing the accessory tendons that bind the ring \ufb01nger to the neighboring \ufb01ngers in pianists (Parrot & Harrison, 1980), so\nthat the ring \ufb01nger had an increased range of independent movement. H\u00e4ger-Ross and Schieber (2000) quanti \ufb01ed the degree of independence\nof the \ufb01ngers in a motor task requiring isolated \ufb01nger movements and reported that the thumb and index \ufb01nger are the most independent\ndigits and the ring and middle \ufb01ngers the least independent.\nIn terms of force production, a number of factors, both neural and mechanical, limits the maximum forces that can be produced when the\n\ufb01ngers act synergistically. This means that the maximum force produced by a \ufb01nger decreases as a function of the number of other \ufb01ngers\nconcurrently generating peak forces. The effect of concurrent activation is considerable, as shown by the 37% increase (range: 22 \u201356%) in the\nmaximum forces produced individually by the \ufb01ngers as compared to the maximum pinch strength measured when all four \ufb01ngers \ufb02ex\nsimultaneously (Ohtsuki, 1981a). The decrease in the maximum force that an individual \ufb01nger can produce with concurrent activation of one\nor a number of adjacent \ufb01ngers is illustrated in Figure 8.9.

Even at the considerably smaller forces used in many functional\nactivities, coactivation of adjacent \ufb01ngers can occur (Kilbreath et al., 2002).\nIt is not only the motor apparatus of the hand that functions as a unit, but its sensory feedback systems also do so. Afferent discharges\noriginating in cutaneous and muscle mechanoreceptors are distributed to various groups of motor neurons in the spinal cord. This means that\nthe sensory signals arising from cutaneous receptors in one digit, such as the index \ufb01nger, in \ufb02uence not only the motor commands sent to that\n\ufb01nger but also those sent to adjacent digits, such as the thumb. When these sensory inputs are eliminated or enhanced, there are signi \ufb01cant\nchanges in the motor commands generated, as revealed by changes in the perceived heaviness of weights. Gandevia and McCloskey (1977)demonstrated these effects using a weight-matching task in which the weights supported by the index \ufb01ngers on the right and left hands were\nmatched in subjective magnitude while the sensory inputs arising from the thumb of one hand were altered. They found that a weight lifted by\ufb02exing the index \ufb01nger was perceived to be heavier when the thumb was anesthetized and lighter when it was electrically stimulated, as\ncompared to controlconditions. The l oss of cutaneous inputs from the thumb and index \ufb01nger following anesthesia also in \ufb02uences the\nmaximum forces that can be produced by the \ufb01ngers. Augurelle et al. (2003) found that when the thumb and index \ufb01nger were anesthetized,\nthe maximum pinch force declined by over 25%. These \ufb01ndings indicate that there is functionalconvergence of the sensory and motor\nsystems involved in cooperative activities of the hand, even when the sensory inputs do not arise from the \ufb01ngers stimulated by the motor\nactivity.\nCoupling of Movements During Typing and Piano Playing\nKinematic analyses of typing indicate that when letters are typed in isolation, there is little within-person variability in the \ufb01nger and wrist\nkinematics from one keystroke to the next when the same key is repetitively struck.

For a given letter, this may range from 130 to 370 ms, depending on\nthe word being typed (Salthouse, 1984, 1986). Movements of the \ufb01ngers of one hand are often highly correlated, and \ufb01ngers adjacent to the\ndigit typing a character frequently \ufb02ex and extend or abduct and adduct together (Fish & Soechting, 1992). This linkage between \ufb01ngers is\ngreatest for the middle and ring \ufb01ngers (Soechting & Flanders, 1997), as would be predicted from other studies of the degree of individuation\nof\ufb01nger movements (e.g., H\u00e4ger-Ross & Schieber, 2000). It is remarkable that even though almost all of the degrees of freedom of the \ufb01ngers,\nthumb, and wrist are in motion when a letter is typed, stereotypical patterns of \ufb01nger movement occur that are idiosyncratic, in that they vary\nfrom person to person, but are consistent within people and are relatively invariant.\nIn piano playing, as was noted in typing, there is little trial-to-trial variability in the kinematics, and so movement sequences are assembled\nstereotypically. Unlike typing, however, there are anticipatory changes to the trajectories of the \ufb01ngers, but these appear to occur only one note\nin advance (Soechting, Gordon, & Engel, 1996). The anticipatory modi \ufb01cation of the \ufb01ngers' movements occurs at times ranging from 165 to\n500 ms prior to striking the key and varies depending on the individual pianist and the musical score being played (Engel, Flanders, &Soechting, 1997). This difference between the two tasks may re \ufb02ect the temporalconstraints on piano pl aying, which are not present when\ntyping.\nBimanual Movements\nBimanualrhythmic movements, such as tapping with two \ufb01ngers synchronously or at some speci \ufb01ed rate (multifrequency tapping) or moving\nthe hands to separate targets, have been the focus of numerous studies of the organizational principles governing voluntary movements (e.g.,\nKelso, 1995; Mechsner, Kerzel, Knoblich, & Prinz, 2001). This research has examined the spatial, temporal, and intensive characteristics of\ncoordination between the hands. When people make rapid movements with their hands to different targets, the initiation and termination ofthe movements are both usually simultaneous, even when the targets have marked differences in terms of their spatial properties. Although thehands move at different speeds to different spatial locations, the times to peak acceleration and deceleration are very similar, as was shown inFigure 7.5, and so movement duration is kept constant (Kelso et al., 1979). The temporal and spatial coupling of movements that is usually afeature of these tasks has been interpreted as a constraint underlying the coordination of the hands (Semjen & Summers, 2002).\nIn contrast to these simple, rhythmic, bimanual movements in which the motions of the hands tend to become synchronized (Kelso, 1984),\nduring typing and other skilled bimanual activities, the hands move simultaneously but often independently of one another. Flanders and\nSoechting (1992) reported that during typing, bilateral \ufb01nger movements are uncorrelated and that motion of one hand does not affect the\ntime course of the movement of the other hand or the variability of movements. Similarly, when playing the piano, the pianist is usuallyrequired to play different patterns of notes with each hand at the same time, and these typically involve different movement trajectories,different levels of intensity, and different timing patterns.

These \ufb01ndings suggest that the constraints that underlie coordination of the hands are task dependent and that, with\ntraining, the timing resources available to the expert performer allow considerable independence in controlling the movements and forces\nproduced by each hand.\nHand Preference\nThe hand that is habitually used to hold a tool when performing a skilled task, such as picking up a small object with tweezers or cutting with\nscissors, is usually referred to as the preferred hand (Old \ufb01eld, 1971). For about 90% of the population, this is the right hand, and the other\n10% are either left-handed or ambidextrous (Corballis, 1991; Lansky, Feinstein, & Peterson, 1988; McManus, 2002).

It is not, however, a dichotomous\nvariable but is distributed along a continuum ranging from strongly right-handed to strongly left-handed individuals. Left-handedness is\nslightly more prevalent in men than women, with about \ufb01ve left-handed men for every four left-handed women, and is more common in\nyounger than older samples of people as social pressures to change handedness in children (i.e., to be right-handed) have diminished over thepast 100 years (McManus, 2002).\nStudies of the differences in the performance characteristics of the preferred and nonpreferred hands indicate that han, dedness is not related\nsimply to a greater independence of \ufb01nger movements or force controlin the preferred hand. There is no evidence of systematic differences\nbetween the hands with respect to the range of motion (Mallon et al., 1991), degree of independence of \ufb01nger movements (H\u00e4ger-Ross &\nSchieber, 2000; Kimura & Vanderwolf, 1970), or control of individual \ufb01nger forces (Reilly & Hammond, 2000). Although the maximum force\nproduced by the preferred hand is usually greater by 3 \u201310% than that produced by the nonpreferred hand in right-handed people, for left-\nhanded people there is much greater variability between the hands in strength, with many left-handers having a stronger right hand(Armstrong & Oldham, 1999; Petersen, Petrick, Connor, & Conklin, 1989). This difference between right- and left-handed individuals re \ufb02ects\na general \ufb01nding on handedness, namely that, as a group, left-handed people are more heterogeneous.\nA variety of activities has been used to evaluate the differences in the performance of the two hands, ranging from pegboard tasks in which\npeople pick up small objects one at a time and place them into target holes as quickly and accurately as possible, to repetitive \ufb01nger-tapping\ntasks (Elliot & Chua, 1996). On many of these measures of manual skill, the preferred hand performs the task more quickly and consistently\nand with fewer errors than the nonpreferred hand. Even with prolonged practice, this performance asymmetry between the hands remains on\nsome tasks (Peters, 1981). For example, on tasks in which people have to pick up and place pegs in holes, the difference in the performance ofthe left and right hands of right-handed people is related to the accuracy requirements for placing the peg, with the left hand being slowerbecause it makes more small corrective movements than the right hand as the peg is placed in its \ufb01nalposition (Annett, Annett, Hudson,\n&Turner, 1979).\nFor\ufb01nger tapping, the superiority of the right hand of right handed people results from more consistent intertap intervals and less variability in\nthe forces produced by the right hand (Todor & Kyprie, 1980; Todor & Smiley-Oyen, 1987). Analyses of the \ufb01nger movements made during\ntapping have also shown that the right hand exhibits shorter intertap intervals and dwell times (key closure) than does the left hand, which\nindicates that the movement reversalphase from \ufb01nger\ufb02exion to extension is executed more ef \ufb01ciently by the preferred hand (Todor &\nSmiley, 1985). This suggests that the ability to time the onset and offset of muscular contractions precisely is superior for the right hand inright-handers. It is not known whether these \ufb01ndings also apply to left-handed people, as left-handers generally use their nonpreferred hand\nmore frequently than do right-handers and tend to be less strongly lateralized on many measures of manual skill (Steenhuis, 1996).\nKinematic and kinetic analyses of limb dynamics during pointing movements have revealed differences in the facility with which limb segment\ndynamics are controlled in the right and left arms of right-handed people.", "doc_id": "ec9221f4-14ca-4b28-bd1a-827583ddcb2a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5d0842cd2b757792450d2f70b9419be9cdc2fd4825c748a9dd6bd0dfbc6d9663", "extra_info": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3808}, "relationships": {"1": "d07ca9f7-8afb-471b-b97c-2bc6fefba2f3", "3": "af67920c-b7ea-4f90-a0be-82f127412ff4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "af67920c-b7ea-4f90-a0be-82f127412ff4": {"__data__": {"text": "movement reversalphase from \ufb01nger\ufb02exion to extension is executed more ef \ufb01ciently by the preferred hand (Todor &\nSmiley, 1985).

Bagesteiro and Sainburg (2002) have shown that muscle torques arebetter coordinated in the shoulder and elbow joints of the right arm than the left of right-handed individuals, with the result that the right armexecutes a pointing movement with much lower torques than the left arm at similar speeds and with similar \ufb01nalposition accuracies. When the\nintersegmental dynamics of the arm are changed by adding an inertial load, the right arm of right-handed individuals adapts more effectively to\nthe novel inertial load than does the left arm (Sainburg, 2002).

We start by examining howthe hand physically develops with respect to its anatomy and the effects of maturation of the central nervous system on hand use. We thenreview the developmental literature, again as this pertains to the four categories used to depict the sensorimotor continuum of human handfunction ( \ufb01gure 1.1).\nPhysical Aspects Pertaining to Hand Development\nThe anatomicalfeatures of the hand are wel ldemarcated at 10 weeks' gestation, and a primitive grasp re \ufb02ex in response to traction across the\npalm can be seen at 12 weeks' gestation (Brown, Omar, & O'Regan, 1997). As the child develops, the size of the limbs gradually increases. Thelength and width of the infant's hand has increased on average by a factor of 200 \u2013300% by the age of 18 years (Flatt & Burmeister, 1979;\nHajnis, 1969). The changes in hand size in early childhood in \ufb02uence the manipulative abilities of the child and affect whether one or two hands\nare required to grasp an object (Newell, McDonald, & Baillargeon, 1993).\nFunctionalmaturation of the centralnervous system is re \ufb02ected in the progression of white matter myelination. It occurs in a \ufb01xed sequence\nthat depends in part on the anatomical level but also on the function of the neural pathways. At the cortical level, myelination occurs \ufb01rst in the\nsensory areas of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortex and then in the motor cortex.

In contrast, the conduction velocity of sensory \ufb01bers in the median and ulnar nerves\nthat innervate the hand has been estimated to reach adult levels by 12 \u201318 months of age (Desmedt, Noel, Debecker, & Nameche, 1973).

A number of studies have shown that there are changes in thenumber, morphology, and distribution of mechanoreceptors in the hands of older adults (e.g., Bolton, Winkelmann, & Dyck, 1966; Bruce,\n1980; Cauna, 1965; Quilliam & Ridley, 1971). Using skin samples taken from cadavers aged 62 \u201383 years, Bruce (1980) found that there was an\nage-related reduction in the number of Meissner's corpuscles, with an estimated decrease of between 23 and 34% across different sites in thehand as compared to the number of corpuscles identi \ufb01ed in amputated \ufb01ngers from young adults. The morphology and distribution of these\nmechanoreceptors also changed with age, becoming more irregular and located away from the epidermis. These results are similar to those ofBolton et al. (1966), who used skin biopsy specimens from the little \ufb01nger to determine the concentration, distribution, and morphology of\nMeissner's corpuscles. In the latter study, the concentration of corpuscles decreased from an average of 24 per mm\n2at 22 years of age to 8.4\nper mm2at 78 years. Pacinian corpuscles also change in morphology and distribution with age. Histological studies of palmar digital skin have\nshown that Pacinian corpuscles gradually decrease in number with age, and those that survive undergo transformations, either increasing in\nsize or remodeling as new corpuscles are formed on the axons of older ones (Cauna, 1965). In contrast to these changes in Meissner's and\nPacinian corpuscles, Cauna (1965) observed that Merkel's corpuscles and the free nerve endings in the dermal papillae do not change radicallywith respect to structure or frequency in postnatall ife. There do not appear to be any reports of the effects of age on the morphol ogy ordensity of Ruf \ufb01ni corpuscles in skin, which may re \ufb02ect the relative infrequency with which these are found in the hand, as described in chapter\n3( P a r\u00b0et al ., 2003). In addition to the histol ogicalevidence of age-rel ated changes in cutaneous mechanoreceptors, severalstudies have shown\nthat there is a loss of large, myelinated axons in peripheral nerves and a slowing of sensory nerve action potentials with age (e.g., Bouche et al.,1993). All of these changes are important to understanding the mechanisms involved in the decline of sensory and motor functions in theelderly, which is discussed in this chapter.\nIn older adults, the skin on the dorsum of the hand undergoes morphological changes and becomes thinner and, consequently, more fragile\nand drier (Roberts, Andrews, & Caird, 1975).

A\nreduction in sweat with increasing age may reduce the friction between hand and object, thus increasing the chance that an object may slipwithin the person's grasp.\nOne of the most common changes in the musculoskeletal system in the elderly is the reduction in muscle mass (by 25 \u201345%), which is\nassociated with a decline in maximum strength (Mathiowetz et al., 1985). Beyond the age of 60 years, there is a progressive loss in the number\nof motor units (the contractile element) in muscles due to the death of alpha motoneurons in the spinal cord. Motoneurons innervating fast-\ntwitch muscle \ufb01bers appear to be most affected in this process (Larsson, Sj\u00f6din, & Karlsson, 1978). This is accompanied by a process of\nreinnervation of some of the denervated muscle \ufb01bers by surviving motor units, which leads to the emergence of larger and slower motor\nunits (Larsson & Ansved, 1995). Such a process means that the muscles of older adults have fewer motor units than those of younger adultsand that these motor units tend to be larger and slower (Carmeli, Patish, & Coleman, 2003).

This decline has been con \ufb01rmed when stimulating\nthe index \ufb01ngerpads of males and females ranging in age from 19 to 88 years. In this study, Thornbury and Mistretta (1981) used a two-\ninterval, forced-choice task with a doublestaircase procedure in which participants were required to decide in which of two intervals thepressure stimulus was applied. Pressure sensitivity declined by a factor of 1.4 across the age range examined. In addition, older individuals(mean of 72 years) are less sensitive by a factor of 2.5 at three sites on the little \ufb01nger relative to younger controls (18 \u201320 years) (Bruce, 1980).\nPressure sensitivity to single indentations (ramp and hold) on the thenar eminence is also lower in older (55 \u201384 years) than in younger (19 \u201331\nyears) individuals (Kenshalo, 1986).\nVibrotactile Sensitivity\nDoes vibrotactile sensitivity also decline with increasing age? Gescheider, Bolanowski, Hall, Hoffman, and Verrillo (1994) varied both stimulusfrequency and contactor size in order to examine the effects of aging on the vibrotactile sensitivity of the four psychophysical channels that\nmediate vibratory sensations on the glabrous skin of the hand (Bolanowski et al., 1988), as discussed in chapters 3 and 4. Participants wererequired to decide which of two intervals contained the stimulus, which appeared in each interval equally often. The 75% correct-detectionlevel was used to determine sensitivity. In one experiment, frequencies spanning a range from 0.4 to 500 Hz were presented to the thenareminence of younger (mean of 23.6 years) and older (mean of 73.6 years) men and women. Collectively , the results indicate that, with age,there is a general decline in sensitivity within all four channels. However, the decline is greater in the P channel (mediated by Pacinian/FA II\nunits) than in the NP I, NP II, and NP III channels (presumably mediated by Meissner/FA I, Merkel/SA I, and Ruf \ufb01ni/FA II units,\nrespectively). Recall that the model assumes that when more than one psychophysical channel is activated, the most sensitive one mediatesvibrotactile sensation (chapter 4). These patterns are evident in \ufb01gure 9.1, which additionally re \ufb02ects the fact that women are more sensitive to\nvibrotactile stimulation than are men. Gescheider, Bolanowski, et al. (1994) have suggested that the loss in sensitivity with increasing age maybe the result of an associated reduction in receptor density (Cauna, 1965). The P channel should be most affected inasmuch as it is capable ofspatialsummation, that is, of integrating neuralactivity across many receptors. Note that the magnitude of temporalsummation, al so mediatedby the P channel, declines with increasing age as well (Gescheider, Beiles, Checkosky, Bolanowski, & Verrillo, 1994).

Since a\ngeneral sensory decline with aging is commonly documented across all of the senses, it is not surprising that an older group discriminatesvibrotactile amplitudes more poorly than does a younger group. What might seem initially puzzling, however, is that when these values areconverted to relative difference thresholds (i.e., Weber fractions, or the proportional change in amplitude detected between a pair of stimuli),discrimination is unaffected by age with the exception of stimulus pairs close to absolute threshold ( \ufb01gure 9.2B). Thus, despite clear age\ndifferences in the absolute difference thresholds, the relative difference thresholds are equivalent. Presumably, this is because the difference\nthresholds for each age group are calculated relative to that group's absolute threshold.

The subjective magnitudes are consistently and substantially lower in a group of older (mean of68.6 years) than in a group of younger (mean of 23.5 years) participants. The difference in magnitude is 16.5 dB. This age-related impairmentmay be attributed to a reduction in the number of Pacinian corpuscles with aging and, possibly, to morphological changes in the receptors andin skin compliance, both of which occur with age (Cauna, 1965).\nThermal Sensitivity\nRegardless of age, absolute sensitivity to cold tends to exceed that to warmth (Stevens & Choo, 1998).

For any run, the gap\nremained constant, while the amplitudes of \ufb02anking and no-gap stimuli were varied using the tracking procedure. Note that the investigators\ndid not just vary the size of a temporalgap. Rather, they measured how intense the stimul i \ufb02anking a gap must be for observers to detect the\npresence of the gap; the smaller the gap, the more intense the surrounding stimuli must be to detect the gap. As expected, tactile temporalacuity (measured as the gap-detection threshold at 75% correct in dB SL) increased with increasing gap duration, although the acuity for short-duration gaps was lower with noise than with sinusoids. Temporal acuity with \ufb02anking noise signi \ufb01cantly decreased with age for gap durations\nof 8, 16, 32, and 256 ms; moreover, the rate of improvement with lengthening gap durations was greater with increasing age. Overall, age had\nless effect on temporal acuity with sinusoids (i.e., only for a duration of 64 ms), and the rate of improvement with lengthening gap durations\nslightly decreased. Different results with noise and sinusoids suggest the engagement of different underlying processes, although it is alsopossible that the result is due to a difference in stimulus complexity. It is notable that the results of the study by van Doren et al. eliminate onepossible mechanism of detection: an integrator of \ufb01xed time constant that operates independently of intensity level. However, other\ninterpretations remain viable, including a version of the multiple look model (e.g., Viemeister & Wake \ufb01eld, 1991), which has been used to\nexplain temporal summation and discrimination in hearing.\nActive Haptic Sensing\nThe effects of age on tactile sensing occur as well when active haptic sensing is used. In this section, we address what is known about theeffects of aging on the performance of a variety of perceptualtasks that invol ve active haptic sensing.\nObject Recognition and Classi \uf001cation\nPiaget and Inhelder (1948) reported that children aged 2.5 \u20133.5 years can easily recognize common objects by touch. Unfortunately , their\nexperimental methodology was not precisely controlled. Since that time, several additional studies have collectively shown that haptic objectrecognition of both familiar and unfamiliar objects begins around 2 \u20133 years of age and improves rapidly up to about 5 years. For example,\nBigelow (1981) showed that, as early as 2.5 years of age, children are able to identify haptically an average of 5.6 out of a total of 7 miniaturecommon objects (e.g., spoon), and that by 5 years their performance is almost perfect. Morrongiello, Humphrey, Timney, Choi, and Rocca(1994) evaluated haptic object recognition of common objects by blindfolded children aged 3 \u20138 years. Both speed and accuracy improved with\nincreasing age. In addition, this study revealed that object parts that are diagnostic of object categories contributed to haptic object\nidenti\ufb01cation, especially in the older children. Finally, Bushnell and Baxt (1999) have shown that, like adults, 5-year-old children are excellent at\nrecognizing unfamiliar as well as common objects.

Berger and\nHatwell (1993, 1995, 1996) examined this issue in a series of experiments that considered whether observers haptically process objects more\nglobally (i.e., on the basis of the overall similarity of all featural dimensions) or more analytically (i.e., on the basis of similarity with respect to\nonly one featural dimension). L. B. Smith and Kemler (1977) had previously shown that while young children visually processmultidimensional objects globally, adults tend to adopt a feature-based rule, which requires analytic (as opposed to global) processing. Bergerand Hatwell (1993, 1995) asked how haptics compared developmentally to vision. They used free-classi \ufb01cation tasks, one of which is shown\nand described in \ufb01gure 9.5.\nUnlike the developmental patterns observed in earlier vision studies, all three age groups (5, 9, and 22 years) classi \ufb01ed multiattribute objects\nmore by their separate featural dimensions (indicating analytic processing) than by their overall similarity (indicating global processing). Ber ger\nand Hatwell argued that the highly specialized nature of EPs (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987) is critical to the more frequent use of analyticstrategies with touch than with vision. Unlike vision, haptic information about object properties is usually acquired sequentially and is oftenincomplete, partly because many exploratory procedures, are highly specialized, regardless of age; moreover, with children, manual explorationis often incomplete. The specialized nature of EPs may also account for the developmental shift from preferring roughness to preferring sizeas a classi \ufb01catory variable. That is, lateral motion, which is highly specialized for texture, was used very frequently by the 5-year-olds; in\ncontrast, enclosure and contour following, which are highly specialized for size, were both rarely executed. The authors attributed instances of\nglobal processing in young children to perceptual factors resulting from the execution of broadly suf \ufb01cient EPs (e.g., enclosure), which provide\ninformation about multiple object properties (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987).

Collectively , the Berger and Hatwell studies are important because they highlight how the haptic and visual systems\nprocess multiattribute objects with regard to global versus analytic strategies, how such strategies change with age, and the relevance of manual\nexploration.\nSchwarzer, Kufer, and Wilkening (1999) extended the developmental investigation of how multiattribute objects are processed by using a\nhaptic category-learning task, which unlike the free-classi \ufb01cation tasks used by Berger and Hatwell, required observers to learn the correct\ncategory-grouping principle, with feedback provided after each trial about the correct categorization. The task was designed to permit the useof either global or analytic processing strategies by allowing the observer to de \ufb01ne a category in terms of the overall similarity of multiple\nobject features or in terms of only one of those features. Children 3 \u20139 years and adults performed the task using very high levels of analytic\nresponding, as previously demonstrated using the same task with vision (e.g., Ward, 1989; Ward & Scott, 1987) and with haptic free-\nclassi\ufb01cation tasks involving texture/size and, to a lesser extent, texture/compliance (Berger & Hatwell, 1993; 1995; 1996). To the limited\nextent that global heuristics were adopted in this task, they were most frequently used by the adults (20%). A developmental trend wasobserved in which material-based (especially texture) learning changed to geometric-based (especially shape) learning with increasing age, aspreviously shown by Berger and Hatwell (1993), with a preference for texture changing to one for size.\nMorrongiello et al. (1994) have addressed the issue of processing multiattribute objects from a different perspective by examining haptic\nidenti\ufb01cation of common objects in children ranging in age from 3 to 8 years. The common objects belonged to one of four categories:\nnormal-sized, miniaturized small objects, miniaturized large objects, and oversized objects. The blindfolded children were required to name\neach common object as quickly and as accurately as possible following haptic exploration. Recognition accuracy increased with age and was\nrelated to developmental changes in the choice of manual exploration strategy. More speci \ufb01cally, the degree to which search was exhaustive\ntended to increase with age. In addition, the types of errors changed; whereas the younger children tended to confuse global form, the olderchildren tended to confuse both global shape and local parts. The authors proposed that the age-related patterns of confusion errors indicatethat children's haptic object representations change from being based primarily on global shape (younger children) to including both globalshape and local parts (older children). Children of all ages had greater dif \ufb01culty identifying miniaturized objects.\nA more comprehensive understanding of how multiattribute objects are processed across the ages is very important for developing models of\nhaptic object processing and for their application to different problem domains, as discussed in chapter 10.

They based their conclusion on several different studies. Forexample, Bushnell, Weinberger, and Sasseville (1989; see also Bushnell & Weinberger, 1987) showed that 12-month-old infants (and, to a lesserextent, 9-month-old infants) leaned forward more to examine haptically the non-visible backs of dowels covered in fur, sandpaper, or bumpsthan backs that were smooth.

Additional evidence for haptic\ntexture discrimination as early as 6 months of age is provided by Steele and Pederson (1977; see also Pederson, Steele, & Klein, 1980), C. F.Palmer (1989), and Lockman and McHale (1989), who showed changes in behavior (e.g., manual or looking) associated with coarse differencesin texture.\nAlthough previous studies had suggested that at younger ages infants may not be capable of perceiving texture haptically, more recent studies\nhave pushed back the estimated age by assessing texture differentiation in infants 4 \u20136 months of age (Morange-Majoux et al., 1997) and in\nneonates (Molina & Jouen, 2003). In the Morange-Majoux et al. study, the infants were allowed unconstrained tactual exploration of a large\nhorizontal cylinder, whose surface alternated in \u201csmooth \u201dand\u201crough\u201dsections, although details concerning the two textures were not\nprovided. The texture variation was discernible haptically but not visually. Analysis of the videotaped hand movements indicated that infantsincreased the frequency and length of active exploration (compared to static contact), particularly from 4 to 5 months. Whichever hand wasused, purposive exploration was described as being most often in the form of an adultlike lateral motion EP , which has been shown to beoptimal for obtaining precise texture information (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987). It should be noted that manual exploration was not scoredexplicitly in terms of the occurrence of any other adultlike EPs described by Lederman and Klatzky. Nevertheless, all infants actively explored\nthe boundaries between the rough and smooth sections. The right hand performed the lateral motion EP more often than did the left hand,\nparticularly on the rough texture; in contrast, the left hand performed this EP predominately at the texture boundaries as early as 4 months of\nage. Collectively , these \ufb01ndings suggest that texture discrimination may occur in infants as early as 4 months.\nMost recently, Molina and Jouen (2003) assessed texture perception in neonates (3 \u20135 days old) by recording the manual activity (hold time,\nhand-pressure frequency) of the right hand in the presence (test interval) or absence (pre- and posttest intervals) of a second object heldsimultaneously in the left hand. On half of the trials, the texture density of the two objects matched (rough-rough, smooth-smooth); on theother half, it did not (smooth-rough, rough-smooth). Manual activity was measured when the object was placed in the right hand prior to,during, and after a second object was placed in the left hand. Although holding times decreased from pre- to posttest, they did not signi \ufb01cantly\nchange when the texture density was altered. However, there was a striking increase in the frequency of squeezes during the test interval for thenonmatching (compared to the matching) condition, as shown in \ufb01gure 9.6. The frequency of squeezes was determined by recognizing peaks\nin a time series of measured positive hand pressures (described in further detail in the paper).

Moreover, during the earlier period without vision, the infants tendedto squeeze the \ufb02exible object and bang the rigid object against a table, suggesting that the infants did indeed differentiate the objects by\ncompliance. Similar results were obtained by Lockman and Wright (1988) and by C. F.

However, the capacity of younger infants to discriminate hardness remains uncertain.\nTwo studies con \ufb01rm that, at 6 months of age, infants are capable of differentiating objects that are either warm or cool. Bushnell, Shaw, and\nStrauss (1985) and Bushnell, Weinberger, and Sasseville (1989) familiarized 6-month-old infants with cylinders that felt either warm or cool tothe touch. In both cases, the infants were initially familiarized with one of the two objects (warm or cool) and then presented with either thefamiliar object or the unfamiliar object (cool or warm). The infants touched the unfamiliar objects longer than the familiar ones, indicating thatinfants as young as 6 months can differentiate warm and coolobjects by touch.

Using a methodology similar to one used by Bushnell\net al. (1985), Ruff (1982, 1984) showed that neither 9-nor 12-month-old infants touched objects whose weight was familiar longer than thosewhose weight was unfamiliar to them. However, banging, as opposed to other hand movements, such as \ufb01ngering, rotation, transfer,\nmouthing, which could involve moving the object into or out of the mouth, reorienting it within the mouth, or rubbing it against the gums,\nand dropping, tended to occur most frequently with a change in weight; banging also occurred more frequently for objects varying in weight\nthan in texture, and less so (although the difference was not statistically signi \ufb01cant) for objects that varied in shape. Thus, we can tentatively\nexclude the possibility that banging was used exclusively to generate sounds. C. F. Palmer (1989) also documented differences in the ways inwhich both 9- and 12-month-old infants handled (i.e., waved) light versus heavy objects; 6-month-olds did not show such behavioral\ndifferences.160 Hand Function Across the Lifespan", "doc_id": "66bd25cd-b1f1-49f1-9b4c-25f8385968ea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4c008277acdb60e666bc70120896696d4849314c12b02a4b51fcd48f564960e6", "extra_info": {"page_label": "169", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2798}, "relationships": {"1": "184def73-a5ec-4c2e-93dd-d2d741f5e21f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e4b2d68-d0aa-4af3-9c79-c53cee219296": {"__data__": {"text": "Mounod and Bower (1974) provided additional, less-direct evidence in a study in which 9.5-month-old infants appropriately adjusted their arm\ntension to anticipate the object's weight from its visualappearance, whereas infants 6, 7, and 8 months of age fail ed to do so. Based on studies\nthat have generally only indirectly assessed haptic weight perception by infants, Bushnell and Boudreau (1991) concluded that this perceptualcapacity appears to emerge somewhat later than the perception of texture, compliance, and thermal properties, that is, around 9 months of ageat the earliest.\nTo our knowledge, only a handful of studies have examined haptic weight perception by children beyond infancy. For example, Robinson\n(1964) examined the susceptibility of children aged 2 \u201310 years to the well-known haptic size-weight illusion described in chapter 5. The\nyounger children were initially trained to discriminate between weights so that they understood what \u201cheavier \u201dmeant. Robinson reported a\nsize-weight illusion across the entire age range, although the magnitude decreased with age. Robinson proposed that the decrease related to an\nimprovement in the ability to discriminate weight with increasing age. In contrast, Pick and Pick (1967) found that the magnitude of theillusion actually increased with age from 6 to 16 years. This result may be interpreted as indicating that, with increasing age, observers are morestrongly in \ufb02uenced by changes in object volume (see Ellis & Lederman, 1993) or, as Amazeen and Turvey (1996) have suggested, in moment\nof inertia. Pick and Pick suggested that the apparent discrepancy with Robinson's data may lie in the fact that the developmental decreaseobserved by Robinson occurred mainly for subjects younger than 4 years, whereas their subjects were 6 years and older. By this age, it is\nunlikely that preliminary training would on its own have signi \ufb01cantly improved the children's weight discrimination. Clearly, additional research\nis needed.\nOrientation, Size, and Shape\nWe have failed to \ufb01nd any studies that have investigated the haptic perception of orientation by infants. Gentaz and Hatwell (1995) found that\nchildren aged 7 and 9 years made larger errors than adults in discriminating line orientation, with no difference between the two younger ages.Although all three age groups demonstrated an \u201coblique \u201deffect (i.e., the orientation of verticaland horizontall ines is identi \ufb01ed more\naccurately than that of lines presented at 45 \u00b0or 135 \u00b0), adults showed a larger oblique effect than did the two younger groups.\nTo date, evidence of haptic size perception has been obtained in all infant ages tested. For example, Bushnell (1978) showed that 15-month-\nolds could easily detect a visual-haptic discrepancy between a small and a large cube. In addition, C. F. Palmer (1989) reported that 6-, 9-, and\n12-month-old infants all used more unimanual exploration when exploring small as opposed to large objects. We have found no studies that\ndirectly assess haptic perception of size in younger infants. However, Bushnell and Boudreau (1991) have suggested that differences that are\ncharacterized in the following section on shape perception as \u201ctopological \u201dmay also be considered as differences in size. By this de \ufb01nition,\ninfants only 2 \u20134 months of age can haptically differentiate size. Empirical con \ufb01rmation is provided by two studies (Streri, 1987; Streri &\nSpelke, 1988), which will be discussed in the next section on haptic shape perception. Bushnell and Boudreau (1991) tentatively conclude thatinfants may be able to differentiate variations in object size before they can differentiate changes in other object dimensions, such as texture,compliance, and shape, although the recent study by Molina and Jouen (2003) tentatively suggests that texture perception may occur even\nearlier.\nWe turn", "doc_id": "8e4b2d68-d0aa-4af3-9c79-c53cee219296", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a815960dcd0aafb715b4066a0dc2c3427379fb03de1925908baab15a008a3ee8", "extra_info": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3858}, "relationships": {"1": "ffff3ba8-b3cf-48b9-8d9f-978482bdca34", "3": "aa75ede3-f5c3-425f-ab64-8762f6563538"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa75ede3-f5c3-425f-ab64-8762f6563538": {"__data__": {"text": "(1991) have suggested that differences that are\ncharacterized in the following section on shape perception as \u201ctopological \u201dmay also be considered as differences in size.

Bushnell and Boudreau (1991) have categorized infant responses to the shape of stimulus objects in\nterms of those that vary topologically (e.g., stimuli with or without a hole), featurally (e.g., stimuli with edge discontinuities versus smooth\ncontours), or con \ufb01gurally (e.g., stimuli with the same type of feature but that vary in number or spatial arrangement). According to this\nclassi\ufb01cation scheme, infants as young as 2 \u20134 months are capable of haptically differentiating topological shape differences. The results of\nstudies by Streri (1987) and Streri and Spelke (1988), initially referred to in the section on size, are both relevant. They showed that 2-month-old infants can differentiate between a solid disk and a disk with a hole in it by touch (Streri, 1987) and that 4-month-old infants can hapticallydifferentiate between two rings that are either connected or unconnected (Streri & Spelke, 1988; for further details, see below on manual\nexploration).\nThe earliest infant research suggests that from about 6 months of age, infants can differentiateHand Function Across the Lifespan 161", "doc_id": "aa75ede3-f5c3-425f-ab64-8762f6563538", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9e0c74536406e0c4ba28da50850326cee69514b0157c663390a02216416e3422", "extra_info": {"page_label": "170", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3088, "end": 4993}, "relationships": {"1": "ffff3ba8-b3cf-48b9-8d9f-978482bdca34", "2": "8e4b2d68-d0aa-4af3-9c79-c53cee219296"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5534e4b5-f0b3-4f2b-ad10-07e67bd96f81": {"__data__": {"text": "shapes based on featuraldifferences, such as sharp angl es, edges, and protrusions versus smooth curves (e.g., Brown & Gottfried, 1986; Ruff\n& Kohler, 1978; but see Bryant, Jones, Claxton, & Perkins, 1972). However, research by Streri and Molina (1993) and Lhote and Streri (1998)\nindicates that a coarse shape difference can be discriminated by 2-month-old infants. Most recently, Streri, Lhote, and Dutilleul (2000)presented evidence suggesting that this capacity may even be present in newborns. They showed that newborns decrease the length of timethat they hold a cylinder (or prism) presented across successive trials; they subsequently increase holding time when presented with an object\nthat has a different shape, that is, a prism (or cylinder). The authors concluded that even newborns are capable of haptically differentiating acoarse difference in shape. The newborns primarily used a re \ufb02exive grasp, which would make available coarse shape information. There was\nno evidence that newborns performed a contour-following EP, which is necessary (as well as optimal) for adults to obtain precise shape details\n(Lederman & Klatzky, 1987). Rather than detecting con \ufb01gural shape, it is more likely that newborns discriminated shape featurally by detecting\nthe presence (prism) or absence of an edge (cylinder). Adults can manually detect the presence (or absence) of an edge based on a very briefinitial contact, typically lasting about 20 ms, and in one case lasting only 4 ms (Lederman & Klatzky, 1997). To resolve this ambiguity, onecould use object pairs with both members possessing edges or neither possessing edges. For now , we will classify such discrimination as being\nbased on featuraldifferences.\nIt is not until infants are about 15 months, however, that they can haptically perceive shape differences in terms of their overall spatial\ncon\ufb01guration. (Bushnell, 1978; Bushnell & Weinberger, 1987; Landau, 1990). In the Bushnell studies, the stimulus pairs contained the same\nkind of feature (e.g., angles, edges) but varied in terms of the number and position of the features. We regard the ability to detect differences\nhaptically in the overall spatial con \ufb01guration as the best assessment of shape perception. The existing evidence suggests that con \ufb01guralshape\nperception emerges relatively later in infant development.\nBushnell and Boudreau (1993) have graphically summarized the infant literature in terms of a timeline for the development of haptic\nperception of various object properties in newborns and infants. An updated version is presented in \ufb01gure 9.7. In keeping with Bushnell and\nBoudreau (1993), we have only included the time course for shape perception based on spatial con \ufb01guration. Details pertaining to the\nassociated studies are offered in table 9.1. We offer a caveat that these timelines, particularly as they relate to newborns, should be viewed withsome caution, inasmuch as it has been dif \ufb01cult to ensure that performance differences are determined by perceptual differentiation as opposed\nto motoric differences attributable to variations in object affordances.\nThe results of the more-recent infant literature would appear to question earlier work by Piaget and Inhelder (1948), who claimed that\nrecognition of topological forms only begins at about 3.5 \u20134 years of age. This was observed to occur later than for common objects which, as\nwe have previously noted, vary in more ways than just shape. The recognition of geometric (i.e., in Bushnell and Boudreau's terms, con \ufb01gural)\nforms developed still later, at about 4 \u20134.5 years, with explicit differentiation in terms of angles and dimensions not beginning until about\n4.5\u20135.6 years.", "doc_id": "5534e4b5-f0b3-4f2b-ad10-07e67bd96f81", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7a511088e1708a6dc931ee94e74c7bbae9ba6990d870ed8c989da7b27e46b585", "extra_info": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3689}, "relationships": {"1": "24039ff6-8cfa-457f-857b-2e5dade6c0bc", "3": "5a6577ff-59ea-4f32-9ed7-dc999fb37b61"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a6577ff-59ea-4f32-9ed7-dc999fb37b61": {"__data__": {"text": "\ufb01cult to ensure that performance differences are determined by perceptual differentiation as opposed\nto motoric differences attributable to variations in object affordances.\nThe results of the more-recent infant literature would appear to question earlier work by Piaget and Inhelder (1948), who claimed that\nrecognition of topological forms only begins at about 3.5 \u20134 years of age.

Thus, the order in which topological and con \ufb01gural shape perception develops is similar to that documented in the more-recent\ninfant literature, but the earlier studies suggested that it begins much later. In a more carefully controlled replication of the earlier study byPiaget and Inhelder (1948), Hoop (1971) included nursery school children aged 3.5 \u20135.5 years, in 6-month increments. The most consistent age\ntrends indicated that the youngest children recognized signi \ufb01cantly fewer common objects and topological objects than the oldest children.\nCommon objects were recognized more accurately than either topological or geometric objects in all but the youngest age groups. But only the\n5.5-year-old children recognized the topological objects better than the geometric objects. The marked discrepancy above with respect to when\nhaptic shape perception begins is likely due to the greater dif \ufb01culty of the task and stimuli used with young children (more matching objects\nfrom which to choose, smaller featural differences) than those used with neonates and infants. However, the latter studies with neonates andyoung infants indicate that although haptic shape perception clearly improves with age, it does begin considerably earlier than initially claimed.\nTwo studies have collectively addressed the development of haptic shape perception from early to late162 Hand Function Across the Lifespan", "doc_id": "5a6577ff-59ea-4f32-9ed7-dc999fb37b61", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cbaf07039366c12fc8da1e8f1f0685d0ca6eb4ba4eb3e0314ed8c02bd4dbe9b4", "extra_info": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2939, "end": 5095}, "relationships": {"1": "24039ff6-8cfa-457f-857b-2e5dade6c0bc", "2": "5534e4b5-f0b3-4f2b-ad10-07e67bd96f81"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "42c25769-fff0-4d6c-b15a-3b29831a3856": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 9.7.

Morange-\nMajoux et al. (1997) con \ufb01rmed that, as early as 4 months, infants are capable of discriminating coarse variations in texture. In keeping with\nBushnell and Boudreau's hypothesis linking manual and haptic perceptual development, infants' hand movements proved similar to the adultEP known as lateral motion, which is optimal for extracting texture. Lederman and Klatzky (1987) noted that the choice of end effector didnot in\ufb02uence the association between EP and object property, although certain end effectors do provide more precise information than others.\nIn keeping with this observation, when infants actively explored the textured cylinder, although they used both their whole hand and \ufb01ngertips\nat 4 and 5 months, by 6 months of age the infants primarily used their \ufb01ngertips. Presumably, this is in keeping with the fact that myelination\nof the pyramidaltract occurs around 4 months (cited in Morange-Majoux et al ., 1997), which is important for organizing distalmovements\nthat underlie the development of manual exploration. Furthermore, a lateral-motion EP executed with the \ufb01ngertip (compared to the palm)\nprovides the most precise information about texture because of the relatively high density of mechanoreceptors. As mentioned earlier, Molinaand Jouen (2003) measured the frequency of squeezes in matching and nonmatching texture conditions using neonates. It is well known thatneonates execute grasps re \ufb02exively. However, they executed signi \ufb01cantly more squeezes in the non-matching than in the matching texture\ncondition, suggesting that neonates could differentiate a coarse change of surface texture. Lederman and Klatzky (1987) have shown that whilenot optimalfor providing precise texture information, the encl osure EP (grasp) does provide coarse information about surface texture.\nStreri, Lhote, and Dutilleul (2000) used a habituation paradigm with neonates to show that they grasp a novel object longer than a familiar\nobject. These authors also suggested that the re \ufb02exive grasp may afford the additional perceptual functions of an enclosure EP . Accordingly,\nan enclosure EP could provide suf \ufb01cient, but not optimal, information about shape to neonates. We must, however, keep in mind that edge\ndetection would also permit the neonate to differentiate the two stimulus shapes (prism versus cylinder), but such success would not be basedon true haptic perception of the object's con \ufb01guration. The same may be said with respect to the \ufb01ndings of Streri and Gentaz (2003).\nIn all of the neonatal and infant studies reported above, manual exploration was data-driven, by which we mean that hand movements were\nguided by the stimulus and its properties. The developmental study of knowledge-driven EPs would constitute a signi \ufb01cant addition to this\nliterature. In one study, Klatzky, Lederman, and Mankinen (2005) focused on whether preschool children aged 4 years and 7 months couldmake appropriate judgments about tool function using touch and/or vision. The children were asked to decide and report verbally whether a\ntool (spoon or stick) could be used to perform a particular task (move a candy or stir sugar or gravel, respectively).

If the dorsalsurface of\nthe hand is stimulated, this re \ufb02ex can be inhibited or the hand can open re \ufb02exively (Twitchell, 1970). Claims that newborns are capable of\nopening their hands to \ufb01t the size of an object presented to them (e.g., Bower, 1972) have not been supported in more-recent quantitative\nstudies of infant reaching and grasping (Hofsten, 1982; Hofsten & R\u00f6nnqvist, 1988). It appears that, in the earlier studies, the movements\nwere usually imprecise and not necessarily related to the presence of visual objects. However, it has been shown that newborn infants (10 \u201324\ndays old) will deliberately move their hands to counteract external forces applied to their wrists in order to keep their hands in the \ufb01eld of view\nand that they move their arms more when they can see them (van der Meer, van der Weel, & Lee, 1995). These movements are presumablyimportant precursors to the development of reaching as they assist the infant in developing a frame of reference for action.\nStudies of reaching in infants and young children usually involve presenting an object in front of the children, which they then reach for and\ngrasp. As with many developmental studies, task constraints can have a signi \ufb01cant effect on the behavior manifested. In studies of reaching,\nthe position and size of the object and its base of support, that is, whether it is stabilized by an experimenter, attached to a rod, or resting on atable, in \ufb02uences the grasping behavior observed. In their study of infant reaching and grasping, Newell, Scully, McDonald, and Baillargeon\n(1989) presented an object in the outstretched hand of the experimenter and reported that 71% of infants reached and grasped at 4 months. In\ncontrast, Fetters and Todd (1987) presented a stationary object on a table in front of the infants and observed that grasping is oftenunsuccessfulat 7 months. Under these l atter conditions, the rate of success in grasping the object increased signi \ufb01cantly (90%) by 8 \u20139 months\nof age (Fagard, 1998). An additionaltask constraint that may in \ufb02uence the type of prehensile response seen in young children and that has\nvaried in different experimental studies is the postural position of the child (i.e., seated, reclined, prone, or supine) and whether the child is abl e\nto maintain an upright seated posture without support (Newell & McDonald, 1997).

Infants who have achieved postural control and are ableto sit on their own tend to reach toward objects with one hand, whereas children who have yet to attain postural control (nonsitters) use theirarms symmetrically so that the hands meet in the midline (Rochat, 1992).\nThe capacity to reach for objects develops gradually from birth, but even neonates (1 \u20132 weeks) are capable of moving their arms toward an\nobject of interest presented in front of them (Hofsten, 1982). The movements are made while the neonate is looking at the object, andalthough the movements never result in grasping and the hand rarely makes contact with the object, they are all directed toward the object andbring the hand into the visual \ufb01eld of view . In some of these \u201cprereaching \u201dmovements, the hand actually slows down as it approaches the\nobject. Hofsten (1984) conducted a developmental study of the form and frequency of these movements in a cohort of 23 infants from birththrough 19 weeks of age. He found that there was a gradualdecrease in the frequency of prereaching movements directed toward the objectand that the frequency of the movements reached a minimum at166 Hand Function Across the Lifespan", "doc_id": "18689e6c-6d28-4334-a3e9-f7a395e1da77", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b9c7e02cefd1f5b0a7f1c5012e1788fb465814fc6a5ebf80b13dda0d9363a347", "extra_info": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2924, "end": 4749}, "relationships": {"1": "6df25f62-99e7-42ec-bdd3-d0aeb7b42b22", "2": "5a96afd9-d4e7-444d-8bc5-1961b1078390"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6057ff6c-3df6-4de2-a0e9-e496b3f40b48": {"__data__": {"text": "about 7 weeks of age. The number of these movements then increased dramatically: at the same time, there was a change in the posture of the\nhand as the arm moved forward. In the early weeks, the hand was open, that is, the \ufb01ngers tended to be extended as the arm extended as part\nof an extension synergy. By about the 7th week, this pattern changed, and infants made a \ufb01st as the arm extended, which indicates the\nbeginning of independent controlof the arm and hand. At around 16 \u201320 weeks of age, the infants reached toward and grasped the object,\nshowing that the two systems are somewhat differentiated at this age.\nReaching skills undergo considerable changes in infants from 15 through 36 weeks of age, particularly with respect to the \ufb02uidity of the\nmovement. In infants aged 12 \u201316 weeks, the reaching response consists of a series of submovements (as judged by zero crossings in the\nacceleration record), which results in a long, fragmented movement trajectory that covers less than half of the total distance in the \ufb01rst part of\nthe trajectory (Hofsten, 1979). By 36 weeks of age, the totalmovement path has decreased considerabl y, and the initialmovement now covers\nmore than 70% of the total distance, so that the hand is brought near the target with a single movement (Hofsten, 1991). This latter patternresembles that seen in adults.\nAt 3\u20134 months of age, voluntary prehension begins to appear as infants learn to grasp objects by \ufb02exing all of their \ufb01ngers against the palm in\na palmar grasp (K. J. Connolly & Elliot, 1972). At this age, changes in hand orientation as a function of the orientation of the object start todevelop when the child reaches for an object (Hofsten & Fazel-Zandy, 1984). By 4 \u20135 months, infants can reach successfully for an object and\ngrasp it when it comes in contact with the hand (Hofsten, 1984), and by 6 \u20137 months they begin to close the hand prior to contact with the\nobject. In a detailed study of grasping in infants aged 5 \u201313 months, Hofsten and Ronnqvist (1988) used LEDs to measure the positions of the\nthumb and index \ufb01nger as infants reached for and grasped sphericalwooden objects (1.5 \u20133.5 cm diameter) mounted on a movable rod placed\nin front of them. They observed that in 5- to 6-month-old infants, 75% of the grasps occurred within 100 ms of encountering the object sothat the closing of the hand was well timed in relation to contact with the object. Even at this age, the approach of the hand and grasping ofthe object were coordinated actions, and visualcues were used effectivel y to controlthe grasp (i.e., to estimate the distance and direction ofmovement). As has been observed with adults, these infants planned their grasps during the reaching phase of the movement with the handstarting to close during the ongoing movement. Infants aged 13 months integrate reaching and grasping more consistently than do youngerchildren, who initiate the grasp earlier in the reaching phase and at a greater distance from the object. In addition, 9- and 13-month-oldchildren begin to adjust the aperture of the hand for object size, but 5- to 6-month-old infants do not change their hand aperture consistently,\nas shown in \ufb01gure 9.8. Even in the older children, hand aperture is not scaled in proportion to object size. In the younger children, this may be\ndue to visuall imitations in perceiving differences in the sizes of the objects presented or may re \ufb02ect an inability to use visual information to\npreprogram grip size.

The point at which two hands are used\nto grasp an object can be predicted from hand size. Newell, Scully, Tenenbaum, and Hardiman (1989) observed that, compared to adults,children (3 \u20135 years) use two-handed grasping more frequently than one-handed grasping (60% versus 40% of trials). For cubes larger than 82\nmm, children generally use two hands, whereas for adults the point of shift to two-handed grasping is a cube of 142 mm. However, both adults\nand young children use a single \ufb01nger with the thumb to pick up very small objects. In a further study of grasping in 5- to 8-month-old infants\nand in adults, it was found that the probability of using one or two hands to pick up an object was very similar in both groups when the results\nwere scaled to hand size (Newell, McDonald, & Baillargeon, 1993). Figure 9.9 shows the relation between the ratios of object diameter to hand\nlength and the number of digits used to grasp an object, for infants and adults. The 50% level for switching from one to two hands occurs atapproximately the same object-hand value of 0.75 \u20130.8 for both infants and adults.

Younger children often missed\nthe target on the \ufb01rst attempt at reaching without visual guidance and were clearly much more dependent on visual cues when reaching.\nThe Elderly\nIn the elderly, the primary focus of research on motor performance has been on measurements of reaction time and movement duration, both\nof which increase in people over 60 years of age (Welford, 1988). These age-related changes in performance during middle age and lateadulthood have been documented for many tasks that involve a speeded component and affect all domains, namely, motor, perceptual, and\ncognitive (Salthouse, 1985). It has therefore been assumed that they result from a single common cause and are mediated by a reduction in\nprocessing speed, although there are different patterns of age-related decline in different cognitive tasks.\nKinematic analyses of reach-to-grasp movements in the elderly show only subtle differences when compared to those of younger individuals.\nIn older individuals, as in younger adults, there is parallel activation of the transport and manipulation components when reaching for an\nobject, with the kinematic patterning of both components being in \ufb02uenced by the characteristics of the object to be grasped. There are no age\ndifferences in the time-to-peak wrist velocity or the time-to-peak aperture of the hand as the hand reaches to grasp an object (Carnahan,Vandervoort, & Swanson, 1998). However, movement duration is longer for older participants, and the peak acceleration and deceleration ofthe arm are lower as the hand reaches for the object (Bennett & Castiello, 1994). It has been proposed that the longer deceleration time of\nelderly people re \ufb02ects a conservative movement strategy, in which more time is allocated for placing the \ufb01ngers precisely on the object being\ngrasped.\nGrasping\nInfants and Children\nThe patterns of hand use in early childhood have been the focus of many developmental studies, ranging from the naturalistic observations ofthe late 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g., Dearborn, 1910: Shinn, 1893) to the seminal work of Gesell (1928) and Halverson (1931), who\nconducted experimental studies with groups of young children to map the development of prehension. They viewed maturation as the\nregulatory mechanism in the process of development and so assumed that there was an orderly, and relatively invariant, sequence of prehensiledevelopment as the nervous system matured. More recently , the relation between motor and cognitive development in infancy has been of\ninterest to those studying prehension. The focus of this research has been on how changes in cognitive capacity during infant maturation\nin\ufb02uence the ability to perceive and interact with the environment (Connolly & Elliott, 1972). This approach has also assumed a relatively\norderly sequence of development of prehensile skills. Another perspective from which infant motor development has been conceptualized isthe dynamic systems approach (Thelen & Smith, 1994), which proposes that new motor skills result from the interactions of the developingnervous system with perceptualprocesses and the environment.\nThe sequence of prehensile development progresses from re \ufb02exive neonatalgrasping (described earl ier), through grasping initiated by contact\nwith an object (i.e., tactile stimulation), to visually guided grasping.

Most of these early grips do not allow for movement of the \ufb01ngers,\nand so they are called rigid grips (Connolly & Elliot, 1972). Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children develop a wide range of prehensile\npatterns that permit movements of the \ufb01ngers while grasping in what are described as \ufb02exible grips (Manoel & Connolly, 1998).\nThere have been several studies of the development of prehensile force control in young children using the instrumented grip objects\ndescribed in chapter 6 (e.g., Forssberg, Kinoshita, Eliasson, Johansson, Westling, & Gordon, 1992).

The child grips the object between the thumb and index \ufb01nger and lifts it from the table while the vertical\nmovement and the grip and load forces are recorded. Some younger children often use the middle \ufb01nger in addition to the index \ufb01nger for\nadditional support when lifting (Forssberg, Eliasson, Kinoshita, Johansson, & Westling, 1991). In adults, there are parallel increases in the grip\nand load forces as the object is grasped prior to lifting, and the entire loading phase is programmed in one force-rate pulse. A speci \ufb01c pattern\nof muscular activity and associated force development characterizes each phase of the grip and lift movement, and these are programmed toachieve speci \ufb01c goals. Children below the age of 2 years do not demonstrate this parallel force programming, instead generating grip and load\nforces sequentially. They often produce a negative load force initially by pressing the object against its support surface, increasing the force insteps with multiple force-rate pulses until the object is lifted from the support surface, as illustrated in \ufb01gure 9.11 (Forssberg et al., 1991). By\nthe onset of a positive load force, the grip force is already large, and a high grip force is maintained throughout all phases of the lifting task. Forchildren younger than 2 years, the peak grip force can be twice that used by adults (Forssberg et al., 1991). These high grip forces result in large\nsafety margins (as de \ufb01ned in chapter 6), which are being used to prevent slips. Up to 3 \u20134 years of age, children generate a larger safety margin\nfor rough materials than is required to prevent slips (Forssberg, Eliasson, Kinoshita, Westling, & Johansson, 1995). This suggests that they areunable to use tactile information to adapt the grip force to the friction conditions. However, the high safety margins may also be related to thelarge\ufb02uctuations in grip force (see \ufb01gure 9.11) seen in young children.\nIn contrast to adults, children younger than 6 years show considerable variability in the grip and load forces produced as they repeatedly lift an\nobject, and they generate excessive oscillating grip forces during the static phase of lifting, as shown in \ufb01gure 9.11 (Forssberg et al., 1991). The\nhigher safety margins adopted by children under 5 may compensate for these \ufb02uctuations in force and so reduce the probability that the object\nwill be dropped.

The anticipatory controlof grip force based on previous experience with the object emerges between 1 and 2\nyears of age but is still immature until 4 \u20136 years (Forssberg et al., 1992). This means that it takes longer for young children to build up an\ninternalrepresentation of an object's weight based on experience and to use this information to assist in programming their grasping forces.Visual cues about an object's size are used by adults to estimate the weight of an object and so help in programming the grip force required tolift an object (Gordon et al., 1991a). Children are unable to use size information for anticipatory control of grip forces before the age of 3,\neven though they respond to differences in weight by 1.5 \u20132 years (Gordon et al., 1992). This suggests that the association between size and\nweight involves further cognitive development in which the properties of different objects must be related to each other. When this associationdoes emerge, children are much more in \ufb02uenced by it than are adults, even if the size cues are not meaningful (Gordon & Forssberg, 1997).\nThese \ufb01ndings suggest that there is a separation between the visualperception of size for the purposes of perception and action, as rel ated to\ngrasp formation. Studies of the size-weight illusion in young children indicate that children as young as 2 years are in \ufb02uenced by the size of\nobjects in their judgments of weight (Robinson, 1964). When grasping objects, however, they do not use these size cues to anticipate the gripforces that are required.\nThe adaptation of grip forces to the friction condition between the object and the hand relies on feedback from cutaneous mechanoreceptors\nin the \ufb01ngerpad, as described in chapter 6 (Johansson & Westling, 1988). Children begin to respond to these friction conditions around 18\nmonths of age provided they are repeatedly exposed to the same surface material on the object being lifted. Figure 9.12 illustrates the force\ntrajectories of children (20 months and 8 years) and adults when lifting an object covered in sandpaper or silk. Young children (less than 5\nyears) use much higher grip forces than do adults for less slippery materials, such as sandpaper, and so adopt high safety margins to prevent\nthe object from slipping between the \ufb01ngers. The sizes of these safety margins gradually decrease in children between 1 and 5 years as the child\nmatures and is able to use tactile friction information more effectively to modulate grip force (Forssberg et al., 1995).\nIn summary, the control of prehensile force in children undergoes considerable re \ufb01nement as the sensory and motor systems develop, but it is\nnot untilthe age of 11 \u201315 years that the anticipatory controlof grip force reaches maturity. Prior to this, young chil dren are abl e to compensate\nfor their limited prehensile abilities by using higher grip forces than are required to prevent slipping and by prolonging the movement phasesassociated with grasping and lifting objects. These strategies become less important as the ability to integrate sensory information develops andas the neural mechanisms controlling prehension mature.\nThe Elderly\nImpairments in grip force and \ufb01ne manual dexterity are frequently reported in the elderly.

This slowing of motor performance\ncannot be attributed to a generalsl owing of function, as it appears to affect \ufb01ne manual skills much more than gross manipulation (C. D. Smith\net al., 1999). Changes in the grasp forces used to hold objects have been reported in the elderly and are presumed to be related to this declinein dexterous manipulative abilities. Cole and his colleagues (Cole, 1991; Cole & Beck, 1994; Cole, Rotella, & Harper, 1999) and Kinoshita andFrancis (1996) have used an instrumented test object similar to that developed by Johansson and his colleagues (described in chapter 6) to\nstudy the controlof \ufb01nger grip forces in the elderly. In all of these studies, the grip forces used by older people (69 \u201393 years) were found to be\nmore than twice as large as those used by younger adults (18 \u201332 years), and the safety margins of older participants were signi \ufb01cantly higher\nthan those of younger individuals (see \ufb01gure 9.14). The large safety margins used by the elderly may compensate for reduced tactile acuity on\nthe\ufb01ngertips (Stevens, 1992), which would result in an impaired ability to encode friction information at the skin-object interface (Cole et al.,\n1999). The friction at this interface is encoded by fast adapting afferents with small receptive \ufb01elds (FA I), with Meissner's corpuscles being the\nputative ending (Vallbo & Johansson, 1984). Histological studies have revealed that these receptors decrease substantially in number in theelderly and that they undergo morphological changes (Bolton et al., 1966; Cauna, 1965), as described in the introduction to this chapter.\nAge-related changes in skin properties, such as friction, must also be taken into account in explaining the higher safety margins adopted by\nolder people when grasping small objects. Kinoshita and Francis (1996) found that the coef \ufb01cient of friction of their elderly participants was\n67% to 83% that of the younger individuals, indicating that the \ufb01ngers of the older people were more slippery than those of the younger\nadults. This presumably results from the reduced eccrine sweat gland output (Silver, Montagna, & Karacan, 1965) and the associated decrease\nin the moisture content of the skin that has been described in the elderly (Potts, Buras, & Chrisman, 1984).\nThe relation between manual dexterity and tactile spatial acuity on the \ufb01ngertips has been investigated in several studies with older adults.\nTremblay, Wong, Sanderson, and Cote (2003) found that in their group of 33 older adults (aged 60 \u201395 years), there was a signi \ufb01cant positive\ncorrelation (r=.66) between the spatial tactile threshold, measured using a grating-orientation test, and manual dexterity scores, measured on\nthe grooved-pegboard test. These \ufb01ndings were interpreted as indicating that impaired tactile sensation contributes to the decline in manual\ndexterity in the elderly. However, the strength of this relation does seem to depend on the motor task used to evaluate dexterity and themeasure of tactile acuity selected. Cole, Rotella, and Harper (1998) found that impaired tactile sensations, as de \ufb01ned in terms of pressure\nthresholds, did not affect their participants' ability to grasp and lift a small sphere as long as the properties of the object being grasped and\nlifted were predictable.

These\ntests include items that evaluate hand function in terms of grasping, hand use, eye-hand coordination, and dexterity . They are primarily used toidentify developmental problems in high-risk infants and young children, and so they focus on detecting abnormalities in hand use. The testsusually consist of items that are assessed as being performed or not performed.\nIn school-aged children, hand function has been evaluated using tests of \ufb01ne manualdexterity, such as the Purdue pegboard test (Tif \ufb01n, 1968).\nIn this test, the individual picks up a peg from a well at the top of a board, places it in a hole on the board, and continues to do so for 30 s asquickly and accurately as possible. The performance of each hand individually and both hands together are evaluated in terms of how manypegs are placed in the holes within the time limit. There are also assembly tasks that involve placing washers and collars on the peg using both\nhands. Gardner and Broman (1979) measured the performance on this test of more than 1300 children aged 5 \u201316 years and found that scores\nincreased monotonically with age and had not reached adult levels at 16 years. In this study and one involving individuals aged 14 \u201319 years\n(Mathiowetz, Rogers, Dowe-Keval, Donahoe, & Rennells, 1986), girls consistently obtained higher scores (i.e., placed more pegs) than boys.This test has been used with younger children (2 \u20136 years), who also demonstrated improved performance with increasing age and higher\nscores with the preferred (right) hand, although this was more evident in the older age groups (Wilson, lacoviello, Wilson, & Risucci, 1982).The ability of children to perform functional activities, such as writing and manipulating small objects, has been evaluated using the Jebsen testof hand function, a timed test comprising seven subtests: printing a sentence, turning over index cards, picking up small common objects andplacing them in a container, stacking checkers, simulated feeding, moving large empty cans, and moving large weighted cans (Jebsen, Taylor,\nTrieschmann, Trotter, & Howard, 1969). The time taken to perform this test decreases from 6 \u20137 years until10 \u201311 years, at which age the level\nof performance is comparable to that of adults (Taylor, Sand, & Jebsen, 1973).\nThe Elderly\nMost studies of hand function in the elderly have used standardized dexterity tests or functional activities to evaluate performance. On testsinvolving reaching and picking up small objects and then placing them in holes, such as the Purdue pegboard test, the elderly are slower than\nyounger adults. In a three-year longitudinal study of 264 60- to 90-year-olds (mean age: 72 years), Desrosiers, Hebert, Bravo, and Rochette\n(1999) reported that over the 3-year period, there was an 8% decline in performance on the Purdue pegboard test and that gross manual\ndexterity declined 13%, as measured using the box-and-block test (a test consisting of moving the maximum number of blocks within 60 sfrom one side of a box to the other, across a partition).

These include tapping\nas fast as possible with a stylus on a contact plate, tapping with one or two digits (usually the index \ufb01nger) on a key as rapidly as possible, or\nfollowing the steady rhythm of a metronome by tapping with the \ufb01ngers. The tapping speed of younger children (5 years) is signi \ufb01cantly slower\nthan that of older children (6 \u20139 years), which re \ufb02ects both a longer dwell time (the delay before initiating the next response) and a prolonged\ndeceleration phase as the \ufb01nger approaches the key in the younger children (Schellekens, Kalverboer, & Scholten, 1984). When children are\nasked to maintain a steady tapping rhythm with their left and right index \ufb01ngers alternately, using the beat of a metronome, girls (6 \u201312 years of\nage) are more accurate than boys in following the rate of the metronome and are better at maintaining a steady beat. In both girls and boys, the\nright hand is steadier than the left (Wolff & Hurwitz, 1976). These manual asymmetries and sex differences become less evident after the age\nof 12 years.\nPointing movements have been studied in school-aged children (5 \u201312 years) with the objective of understanding how proprioceptive and\nvisualcues are integrated during movements and what factors affect the precision with which the movements are executed. Hofsten andR\u00f6sblad (1988) studied manual pointing movements using a task in which the children were required to look at a target dot on a table and thenplace a pin underneath it as precisely as possible. The availability of visual and proprioceptive cues was controlled in different experimental\nconditions. In some trials, only visual cues were available to locate the target. In others, proprioceptive cues were used to locate the target by\nplacing the \ufb01nger on it and then participants closed their eyes while they reached underneath the table to place the pin on the target. Finally,\nboth visualand proprioceptive cues were avail abl e when one \ufb01nger remained in contact with the target, at which the child looked, while the\nother hand placed the pin underneath it. In all conditions, pointing errors decreased with age, with most of the decline occurring between theages of 5 and 9 years. Performance was signi \ufb01cantly better when visual cues were available, and the addition of proprioceptive cues did not\nresult in an increase in pointing accuracy. In addition, when only proprioceptive cues were available, errors were considerably higher (by about5\u20138 mm) than when the target location was de \ufb01ned visually. The superiority of visual control in pointing accuracy found in this study is\nconsistent with \ufb01ndings in adults and has been reported in other studies with children using different tasks (e.g., Pick, Pick, & Klein, 1967).\nStudies of the accuracy of aiming movements using Fitts' task (described in chapter 7) have been undertaken in school-aged children\n(Connolly, Brown, & Bassett, 1968; Hay, 1981) but not in very young children. In adults, the time taken to reach a target is determined by the\namplitude of the movement and the accuracy requirements or endpoint tolerance for the movement (see chapter 7).

In adults, the time taken to reach a target is determined by the\namplitude of the movement and the accuracy requirements or endpoint tolerance for the movement (see chapter 7). Fitts' law does apply to\nchildren over 5 years of age, and between the ages of 5 and 12 years, movement time on this task decreases. This presumably re \ufb02ects an\nimproved ability to control the muscle forces required to transport the arm between the two targets. There is also a decrease in the slope of the\nfunction relating the index of dif \ufb01culty (ID) to movement time (MT) with age (see \ufb01gure 9.15), which has been interpreted as indicating that\nnot only are the movements more rapid in older children, but they become more accurate for any given distance (Hay, 1981).\nPointing movements have been studied in older individuals (55 \u201385 years), who were required to touch a target location with a pen held in their\nhands after perceiving the target either visually or kinesthetically. In the visual condition, participants \ufb01rst saw the target and then, with their\neyes closed, attempted to touch the target; in the kinesthetic condition, the target location was \ufb01rst perceived only kinesthetically by passively\nmoving the participants' hands to the target location and then back to their laps. The participants then actively returned their hands back to the\nperceived target location. Using this task, Lovelace and Aikens (1990) found that there was no effect of age on the accuracy with which people\nreached for the target, independently of how its location was perceived. These \ufb01ndings suggest that proprioception in the arm and hand is\nrelatively well preserved in healthy older adults.\nKinematic analyses of rapid aiming (tapping) movements in elderly participants indicate that they spend more time in the target approach or\ndeceleration phase than do younger adults (Cooke, Brown,176 Hand Function Across the Lifespan", "doc_id": "3ed8320f-9793-4597-bc82-05f920e7b6a3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "32a8816295c473f350d2e4b2f1ee9542b30bc213f2a5e2dd4b76ac803554b764", "extra_info": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2933, "end": 5101}, "relationships": {"1": "2ff4091a-02f8-4d5f-a82f-d5546ba79daf", "2": "c921e9f2-e4b3-4d2b-a63d-a63a1591afcc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "436ef97c-657a-4265-a60c-a84ebd9154c9": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 9.15.

Older people are also more affected than younger individuals by increasing the\naccuracy demands of the task (e.g., making the targets smaller) and make discrete adjustments in the trajectory of the hand. This suggests thatthey are more dependent on sensory feedback during movement execution and do not rely on feed-forward or on-line processes to achievefast and accurate performance, as do younger people (Pohl, Winstein, & Fisher, 1996). As a consequence, the aiming movements of olderpeople become slower, less continuous, and more variable (Morgan et al., 1994; Yan, Thomas, & Stelmach, 1998).\nTyping and Piano Playing\nA few studies of older skilled pianists and typists have focused on analyzing whether highly practiced motor skills are affected by advancingage, like other motor abilities. Salthouse (1984) studied a group of skilled typists aged 19 \u201372 years and found that although there was a\nsigni\ufb01cant increase in choice reaction time and a decrease in tapping rate with age, as had previously been reported (e.g., Welford, 1988), there\nwas no decline in typing speed with age. The relation between age and typing speed (i.e., interkey interval) and choice reaction time is shown in\ufb01gure 9.16. The median interkey intervalin typing was nearl y identicalin typists 20 and 70 years ol d, whereas the choice reaction time\nincreased by 80 \u2013150 ms. There was, however, a signi \ufb01cant effect of age on eye-hand span, that is, the span between the character being visually\n\ufb01xated and the character being typed; typists in their 60s had between 254 and 264 ms additionalpreparation time rel ative to typists in their\n20s, as de \ufb01ned by the product of the eye-hand span and the median interkey interval. This suggests that older typists may compensate for their\ndeclining perceptual-motor speed by more extensive anticipation and overlapping of upcoming keystrokes (Salthouse, 1984). It is also possiblethat the performance of the older typists at younger ages was already superior to that of the younger typists to whom their presentperformance was being compared and that the older typists' skills were better preserved because of a slower age-related decline. A longitudinalstudy of typing skills would be required to address this hypothesis.\nA similar pattern of results was observed in a study of young and old expert and amateur pianists aged 20 to 68 years (12 pianists in each of\nthe four groups). Krampe and Ericsson (1996) reported that performance on music-related tasks showed age-related decline for amateurpianists, but not for experts.

On these\nmeasures, older expert pianists did not demonstrate any signi \ufb01cant decrements in skilled musical performance, as compared to younger expert\npianists. This elite performance had to be actively maintained, however, as task performance was related to the amount of practice in which the\nelderly expert pianists engaged. This measure, and in particular the amount of practice during the last 10 years, correlated most strongly withindividualdifferences in performance, and the rel ation was strongest in the ol der expert pianists.\nKrampe and Ericsson (1996) also found that the choice reaction times of older pianists were signi \ufb01cantly longer than those of younger\npianists, consistent with the \ufb01ndings from older skilled typists (Salthouse, 1984). However, the tapping performance of both younger and older\nexpert pianists was superior to that of amateurs on all three measures of tapping speed (left index \ufb01nger, right index \ufb01nger, alternate index\n\ufb01ngers), and no effect of age was found for either amateur or expert pianists. The latter result is surprising in that tapping speed has\nconsistently been reported to be affected by age, even in skilled typists (Salthouse, 1984). It suggests that the skills required for rapid \ufb01nger\ntapping are related to those acquired and maintained by expert pianists and that a suf \ufb01ciently high level of deliberate practice in later adulthood\npreserves \ufb01ne manual skills.\nThese studies on pianists and expert typists suggest that there is not an inevitable decline in all manual skills with age and that overlearned\nmotor skills, such as piano playing and typing, can be preserved, if they are practiced regularly and frequently (Krampe & Ericsson, 1996). Thespeci\ufb01city of this preservation is surprising, in that related motor tasks, such as pressing a key in response to a cue (choice reaction time) or\n\ufb01nger tapping for skilled typists, are affected by advancing age. It has been proposed that expert pianists and typists acquire speci \ufb01c\nmechanisms (e.g., the enhanced eye-hand span noted in expert typists) that mediate their performance and permit them to overcome the\ngeneral processing limitations that increase with age and affect their performance on other, unskilled tasks (Krampe & Ericsson, 1996).178 Hand Function Across the Lifespan", "doc_id": "aa2aa097-0d81-466a-b0f3-3d4388f45a42", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "50404ae1255c7686b8f534d6c16e44c3013d8b61500b318b752a1ca9e429c183", "extra_info": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2744}, "relationships": {"1": "b566371e-947a-4f08-82fa-aa8452be7216"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed6b6020-1aaa-477a-9491-af8f286fc79a": {"__data__": {"text": "10\nApplied Aspects of Hand Function\nInJapantoday,therearesomanynewdataentrydevicesthatyoungpeoplearecalledoyayubisedai,theThumbGeneration .\nTENNER , 2004\nThe results of fundamental research on human hand function offer valuable information about the capacities and limitations of the human\nuser.

In each case, we begin with a description of theapplication domain, followed by consideration of design issues and possible implications of selected research \ufb01ndings.\nEvaluation of Hand Function and Rehabilitation\nThe clinical evaluation of the hand is of critical importance in determining the extent of functional loss in people with traumatic injuries or\ndiseases and in assessing the outcome of various surgical and rehabilitative procedures. Several aspects of hand function are typically includedin assessment protocols, and these can be grouped into three broad domains. First, the integrity of the musculoskeletal system is measured in\nterms of the maximum force generated by different muscle groups and the range of motion of individual joints. Second, tactile, thermal,\nnociceptive, and proprioceptive sensations may be assessed; and third, the functional capabilities of the hand are evaluated (L. A. Jones, 1989).The particular tests chosen to evaluate hand function vary with the clinical condition and with which aspects of hand use it affects (Callahan,2002; Dannenbaum & Jones, 1993; Varney, 1986). For example, in a person with rheumatoid arthritis, the focus of an evaluation will be on themusculoskeletal system and the functional aspects of the hand, whereas in an individual with a peripheral nerve injury, a comprehensiveevaluation of sensory function would be undertaken together with an assessment of the functional capabilities of the hand.\nMuscle and Joint Function\nThe maximum forces developed by muscles controlling the hand depend on the particular grasp adopted,", "doc_id": "ed6b6020-1aaa-477a-9491-af8f286fc79a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "33ad1cbbdc7c34f7a6c91f991f0ea3dbea19bbc14b5a04cf6cb90a15c431fe21", "extra_info": {"page_label": "188", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2386}, "relationships": {"1": "5fc81acf-ed48-486c-b019-79ae1eae5d18"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1dd9d459-a6b3-41a5-b737-8c87ef031a34": {"__data__": {"text": "which is determined by the task being performed, as described in chapter 8. A loss in grip strength is associated with a number of different\nneurological and musculoskeletal conditions, and so an assessment of hand-grip strength is generally included in hand evaluations as a test of\ngross motor power (Binkofski, Seitz, Arnold, Classen, Benecke, & Freund, 1996; Boatright, Kiebzak, O'Neil, & Peindl, 1997). Several large-scale studies have provided comprehensive normative data on the grip strength of healthy children (Ager, Olivett, & Johnson, 1984;Mathiowetz, Wiemer, & Federman, 1986; Newman, Pearn, Barnes, Young, Kehoe, & Newman, 1984) and adults (Hanten et al., 1999;\nMathiowetz et al., 1985; Schmidt & Toews, 1970; Teraoka, 1979). These studies have indicated the importance of considering the sex, age, andhand preference of the individual when interpreting grip-strength data in clinical populations. They have also shown that although height andweight are positively correlated with grip strength (Hanten et al., 1999; Newman et al., 1984; Schmidt & Toews, 1970), the in \ufb02uence of these\nvariables is considerably smaller than that of either sex or age. The average grip strength of women is approximately 60% that of men, and for\nboth sexes grip strength reaches a maximum during the third decade of life and declines thereafter with increasing age (Hanten et al., 1999;Mathiowetz et al., 1985; Teraoka, 1979). The average difference between the hands in strength is approximately 10% in both leftand right-handed people (Schmidt & Toews, 1970; Thorngren & Werner, 1979; Woo & Pearson, 1927). It has also been shown, however, that the grip\nstrength of the nonpreferred hand is equalto that of the preferred hand in approximatel y 25% of normalindividual s (Bornstein, 1986) and\nthat almost 50% of left-handed people have equivalent or greater strength in their nonpreferred hand (Armstrong & Oldham, 1999; Petersenet al., 1989). Differences between the hands in strength must therefore be interpreted with caution if disability or loss of function is de \ufb01ned in\nterms of such a discrepancy.\nThe maximum forces produced in the three precision grips shown in \ufb01gure 8.5 (i.e., tip, palmar, and lateral pinch) are also frequently evaluated\nin clinical hand assessments. The peak forces generated with the palmar- and lateral-pinch grips are about 40% greater than that produced withthe tip pinch, as illustrated in \ufb01gure 10.1 (Mathiowetz et al., 1985). As would be expected, the factors that affect hand-grip strength, namely,\nage and sex, also in \ufb02uence the maximum forces generated with the three precision grips.

As with muscle-strength measurements, guidelines have been published that specify both the starting position of the hand during\nthese assessments and the placement of the goniometer on the joint being evaluated (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, 1965;Norkin & White, 1985). The data recorded can then be interpreted with reference to published normative data (American Academy ofOrthopedic Surgeons, 1965), and the degree of severity of any impairment can be classi \ufb01ed according to accepted de \ufb01nitions of disabilities\n(American MedicalAssociation, 1993; Swanson, 1964).\nSensory Testing\nTactile sensibility of the hand is evaluated using a number of sensory tests, including many of those described in chapter 4. The most\ncommonly used are two-point discrimination, pressure sensitivity, and haptic object recognition (L. A. Jones, 1989). Other procedures, such as\nvibratory threshold testing and tests of thermal sensitivity , are generally used with particular clinical conditions. For example, vibratory test ing\nis often conducted in people with peripheral nerve injuries (Szabo, Gelberman, Williamson, Dellon, Yarn, & Dimick, 1984) but is lessinformative in individuals with cortical lesions. In this latter group, the perception of vibration can be preserved even when there are de \ufb01cits in\ntwo-point discrimination, haptic object recognition, and position sensitivity (Derouesn\u00e9, Mas, Bolgert, & Castaigne, 1984; R. T. Ross, 1991).\nThe limited usefulness of vibratory testing in patients with cortical lesions was commented on in 1927 by the English neurologist Gordon\nHolmes, who noted: \u201cThe tuning fork is one of the least useful tests in cortical disease, for, as Head has shown, the appreciation of vibration is\npossible through the thalamus alone \u201d(1927, p. 418).\nSpatial acuity on the hand is frequently evaluated using the two-point discrimination test. Although normative data are available for two-point\nthresholds on different regions of the hand, such as the \ufb01ngertips and the transverse axis of the palm (e.g., Corkin, Milner, & Rasmussen,\n1970; Weinstein, 1968), most clinical sensory testing has focused on the palmar surfaces of the distal phalanges because of the highconcentration of tactile mechanoreceptors and the importance of this region to functional use of the hand (Gellis & Pool, 1977; Wynn Parry &Salter, 1976). Two-point discrimination thresholds can vary as a function of the force applied when one point is in contact with the skin as\ncompared to two points and with differences between examiners in the magnitude of forces applied. Brand (1985) has shown that even in\nskilled clinicians these forces can vary from 0.04 to 0.4 N. It should also be kept in mind, as noted in chapter 4, that many researchers datingback to Tawney in 1895 have argued that two-point discrimination is not a measure of tactile spatial acuity (Craig, 1999; Johnson & Phillips,1981; Johnson, Van Boven, & Hsiao, 1994).

This statement is based on the changes in two-point discrimination thresholds that occur withrepeated testing and on the differences in thresholds that result from changing the criteria for judging the presence of two stimuli versus onestimulus. It appears that observers use intensive cues rather than spatial information to discriminate one from two points, that is, a single pointcan feel sharper than two points (Craig & Johnson, 2000). Several other measures show promise in assessing the ability to resolve \ufb01ne spatial\ndetail, including gap detection and grating orientation, both of which were described in chapter 4. These measures do not appear to be\ncontaminated by intensive cues and seem to re \ufb02ect the underlying neurophysiology of the skin. In clinical populations the grating-orientation\ntest has been shown to provide a reliable index of recovery (e.g., Van Boven & Johnson, 1994).\nA variation of the two-point test that involves moving the caliper or two-point aesthesiometer along the surface of the \ufb01nger in a proximal-to-\ndistaldirection has been used to assess sensory function in peopl e with peripheralnerve injuries (e.g., Patel& Bassini, 1999; Wei, Carver, Lee,Chuang, & Cheng, 2000). Dellon (1978, 1981) advocated using these dynamic stimuli to evaluate the integrity of fast adaptingmechanoreceptors in the skin.

For this reason, it is not surprising that they are easier to detect (Louis, Greene, Jacobson,\nRasmussen, Kolowich, & Goldstein, 1984). In people with median or ulnar nerve injuries, Dellon (1978) found that moving two-point\nthresholds decreased more rapidly than static two-point thresholds during the period of recovery following nerve surgery and showed a betteroverall recovery, which suggests that moving two-point thresholds were a more sensitive measure of improvement. Consistent with theseresults on the sensitivity of the test, Robertson and Jones (1994) found that in people with cortical lesions resulting in sensory loss, moving\ntwo-point thresholds could be elevated when static two-point thresholds were within normal limits. These \ufb01ndings are in agreement with the\nobservation that different cortical mechanisms are involved in processing moving and static tactile stimuli. Together, these results suggest thatevaluating the capacity to discriminate moving tactile stimuli is a useful adjunct to the assessment of static thresholds.\nThe ability to localize a point of stimulation on the hand is an important component of sensory function and is often impaired in people with\nperipheral nerve injuries (Hallin, Wiesenfeld, & Lindblom, 1981) and in those with cortical lesions involving the parietal cortex (Rapp, Hendel,& Medina, 2002; Schwartz, Marchok, Kreinick, & Flynn, 1979). In the case of peripheral nerve injuries, the mislocalization of tactile inputsresul ts from misdirected axon regrowth in the peripheralnerve, which causes a disruption of the spatialordering of projections from differentregions of the hand to the cortex (Lundborg, 1993; Wall, Kaas, Sur, Nelsen, Felleman, & Merzenich, 1986). As can be seen in \ufb01gure 10.2,\nwhen tactile stimulation is applied to reinnervated skin after median nerve injury and repair, the stimulus is felt not only in the area of actual\nstimulation but in other skin areas as well (Hallin et al., 1981). For people with cortical lesions, the mislocalization of tactile stimuli is presume d\nto re\ufb02ect the reorganization of the somatosensory representation, which occurs subsequent to the cortical damage (Rapp et al., 2002). Tactile\nlocalization is evaluated by asking people either to point to the locus on the skin that was just touched with a blunt probe (Nakada, 1993) or to\nindicate whether two successive perceptible stimulations were at the same or two different locations on the hand (Corkin et al., 1970;Weinstein, 1968). Performance is scored in terms of the error of localization or the minimal distance that can be discriminated. Localization ismost accurate on the distalpads of the \ufb01ngers with errors averaging 1.5 \u20131.8 mm and is least accurate in the middle of the palm (Nakada,\n1993).\nPressure sensitivity is evaluated using the Semmes-Weinstein mono \ufb01laments, which are an adaptation of the von Frey hairs developed in the\nlate 19th century. The psychophysical method of limits (see chapter 4) is used to determine pressure sensitivity on the \ufb01ngertips, and the\nthresholds measured are then compared to normative data (Bell-Krotoski, 2002; Corkin et al., 1970; Weinstein, 1968).

This is not surprising in that the two tests measure different aspects of\ntactile sensation.\nHaptic object recognition, often called tactile gnosis or stereognosis, is a standard component of many neurological examinations and is\nincluded in many hand assessment protocols (e.g., Brink & Mackel, 1987; Moran & Callahan, 1984). As described in chapter 5, object\nrecognition by active haptic sensing requires the integration of multiple sources of information, particularly the material and geometricproperties of the object. Two methods have been used to assess haptic object recognition in clinical testing. First and most commonly, anobject is placed in the unseen hand, and the person is required to name the object. The time taken to recognize the object is recorded in\naddition to the number of objects correctly identi \ufb01ed. These scores are then compared to the normalresponse times, which are typical l y\naround 1 \u20132 s for common objects (Klatzky et al., 1985). The second method uses a haptic matching procedure to evaluate object recognition.\nWith this method, the person palpates an object in one hand and then attempts to \ufb01nd a replica of it in an array of objects. Haptic matching is\nmore dif \ufb01cult than simply naming the object and has mainly been used in studies of hand function in people with cerebral lesions, who may\nhave language or memory impairments that limit their ability to name an object (Semmes, 1965; Weinstein, 1962).\nDe\ufb01cits in haptic object recognition are frequently associated with elevated thresholds on the two-point discrimination and pressure sensitivity\ntests in people with peripheral nerve damage (Dellon & Kallman, 1983; King, 1997) and with cortical lesions that affect hand function(Robertson & Jones, 1994). A number of terms are used to describe these de \ufb01cits in object recognition consequent to corticaldamage,\nincluding astereognosis, tactile apraxia, and tactile paralysis. In contrast to the situation in people with peripheral nerve damage, in individua ls\nwith cerebral lesions, impairments in haptic object recognition can occur that cannot be attributed to the severity of their primary sensory loss(Caselli, 1993; Reed, Caselli, & Farah, 1996). In these cases, which are usually associated with posterior parietal lobe lesions, sensory threshold s\non the hand are normal or only mildly impaired, but there is a profound de \ufb01cit in recognizing objects haptically , which appears to result from\nan impairment in tactile shape perception and manual exploration strategies (Pause, Kunesch, Binkofski, & Freund, 1989). A kinematicanalysis of the hand movements used by individuals with parietal lobe lesions as they explored objects haptically revealed that there was a\ndecrease in the frequency and regularity of \ufb01nger movements as compared to normalvol unteers, even though repetitive \ufb01nger movements\ncould be performed at normal rates (Binkofski, Kunesch, Classen, Seitz, & Freund, 2001). Moreover, there was a signi \ufb01cant negative\ncorrelation (r=\u2212.92) between the size of the exploration space used to identify the object and the score on the test, where a higher score\nrepresented better performance. This means that the individual \ufb01nger movements were less effectively controlled in people with parietal\nlesions, and the resulting tactile information was not accurately synthesized into a representation of the object.

Improper selectionof EPs has been shown to limit the type of peripheral sensory information available (Klatzky et al., 1987; Lederman, Klatzky, & Reed, 1993;\nReed, Lederman, & Klatzky, 1990). These studies may prove useful as an adjunct to the sensory reeducation techniques that are used with\npeople who have had peripheral nerve transection and repair (Carter-Wilson, 1991; Mackinnon & Dellon, 1988).

Passive movement testing involves having the examiner passively \ufb02ex or extend the proximalor distaljoint of each digit a\nnumber of times (usually 10), and on each trial the person indicates in which direction the digit was moved. Normative data are available forthis test, and from the scores it is possible to determine whether there is a slight, moderate, or severe impairment in proprioception (Corkin,Milner, & Taylor, 1973). Weight discrimination (i.e., barognosis) is less frequently assessed, although it was a common element of neurological\nexams early in the 20th century (Head, 1920). The task typically involves asking the person to indicate which of two weights that are liftedsuccessively by the same hand is heavier (Victor Raj, Ingty , & Devanandan, 1985) or to sort objects varying in weight according to theirperceived heaviness (Caselli, 1993). In contrast to the passive movement test, weight discrimination is an active process and so may be a better\nindicator of the status of the proprioceptive system.\nFunctional Tests\nA number of tests have been developed to evaluate the functional capacity of the hand (e.g., Jebsen, Taylor, Trieschmann, Trotter, & Howard,\n1969; H. B. Smith, 1973) as de \ufb01ned in terms of how the hand is used to perform a set of activities (e.g., picking up objects, writing, turning\ncards, stacking checkers, simulated feeding). The motivation for developing these tests arose from clinical studies of hand function in which itwas found that the results from tests of sensory abilities, such as two-point discrimination and pressure sensitivity, could not be used to predictthe functionalcapacity of the hand. This discrepancy between the resul ts from sensory tests and the functionalcapacity of the hand wascommented on by Moberg (1958, 1962), a Swedish hand surgeon, who then devised tests that related more to hand function than to sensation.\nThe picking-up test in which blindfolded subjects pick up common objects and place them in a container is one such test. Moberg (1962)\nreported that in patients with peripheralnerve injuries, performance on the picking-up test was positivel y correl ated with two-pointdiscrimination thresholds but not with the results on any other test that he used to measure sensory function.\nThe picking-up test became the model from which many other hand function tests were devised (e.g., Dellon, 1981; Ng, Ho, & Chow , 1999).\nUsually each hand is tested separately, and the test is performed with and without vision. Performance is evaluated in terms of the time takento complete the test or the number of responses made within a given time period, as described in chapter 9. Information regarding how thehand executes these tasks in terms of the kinematics of the movements and the forces produced is usually not considered (L. A. Jones, 1989).Unfortunately , the laboratory-based testing systems that have been used for studying reaching and grasping (described in chapter 6) have not\nbeen developed into more generally available clinical tests, although they have been employed in studies of speci \ufb01c patient populations (e.g.,\nForssberg, Eliasson, Redon-Zouitenn, Mercuri, & Dubowitz, 1999; Hermsd\u00f6rfer et al., 2004 [unilateral brain lesions]; M \u00fcller & Dichgans,\n1994; Nowak et al., 2002 [cerebellar lesions]; Robertson & Jones, 1994 [left-hemisphere cortical lesions]).\nLanguage Communication with the Hand\nAs described in chapter 7, the hand can be used as a communication device when other sources of sensory information are limited due to\ndisability or environmental limitations (Kendon, 1993; Klima & Bellugi, 1979).

The hand can also be used to understand speech by placing it on the talker's face and monitoring the articulatory motionsassociated with the speech production process. This method, known as Tadoma, is believed to have been developed by a Norwegian teacher in\nthe 1890s and was \ufb01rst used in the United States in the 1920s by Sophia Alcorn to teach two deaf and blind children, Tad Chapman and Oma\nSimpson, after whom the technique is named (Alcorn, 1932; C. M. Reed et al., 1985). The physical characteristics of speech production thatare sensed by the Tadoma reader include air \ufb02ow, which is felt by the thumb on the lips; the laryngeal vibration on the speaker's neck; and the\nin-out and up-down movements of the184 Applied Aspects of Hand Function", "doc_id": "68d61b88-a50c-4a96-8e29-201692d0c68d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ad11f0483ffe704d58f5e56b37e436381b06552cd706b1eaa39f7607ab843507", "extra_info": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3245, "end": 4744}, "relationships": {"1": "5cf2b17a-b8a7-4701-8fe8-01d13705c264", "2": "20f75236-bfd8-4d12-9db3-b7e88665e1bb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "707ad53c-c840-4124-b5aa-46c7c7758a47": {"__data__": {"text": "lips and jaw .

The speech reception capabilities of\npeople who are both deaf and blind and who are extensively trained in the use of Tadoma are comparable to those of normal subjects listeningto speech in a background of noise, at a speech-to-noise ratio of approximately 0 \u20136 dB (C.

Reed et al., 1992) and has\ndemonstrated the possibilities of speech communication through the tactile domain.\nAnother tactile communication method, which is more commonly used in individuals who are both deaf and blind, is the haptic reception of\nsign language. This method is generally used by deaf people\nFigure 10.3.

The deaf and blind individual perceives the signs produced by the signing hand(s) by\nplacing a hand or hands over the signer's hand(s) and passively tracing the motion of the signing hand(s). The communication rates obtainedwith haptic reception of sign language are lower than those achieved with visual reception of signs (1.5 signs/s, compared to 2.5 signs/s), anderrors are more common with tactile reception (Reed, Delhorne, Durlach, & Fischer, 1995). Nevertheless, the haptic method ofcommunication is effective in deaf and blind individuals who are skilled in its use, and the levels of accuracy achieved make it an acceptablemeans of communication.\nThe performance of the hand as it communicates using the various systems described above and in chapter 7 can be compared in terms of\nwords/s or in terms of information transfer (bits/s; Shannon & Weaver, 1963). The latter is de \ufb01ned as the increase in information that follows\nthe transmission of a signal, which is simply a measure of how much more the receiving system knows about the state of the transmittingsystem after a signalis received than before (Sheridan & Ferrel l , 1974). A comparison of the rates of communication and of informationtransfer for a number of different communication methods is shown in \ufb01gure 10.4 (Reed & Durlach, 1998). As can be seen in the \ufb01gure, the\nhighest rates of information transfer (20 \u201330 bits/s) are achieved when reading, listening to spoken English, or watching the gestures of\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL). Methods of communication that involve interpreting sequential presentations of letters, such as vibrotactilepresentation of Morse code or \ufb01nger spelling, are very inef \ufb01cient (1.4 \u20138.1 bits/s) when compared to speech and sign language.

Although most commonly explored by eye, tangible graphic displays are meant to be read by hand as a method of providingspatial information to users with limited or no vision. Tangible graphic displays have been employed as supplements to Braille for classroomlearning of a variety of disciplines, such as geography, the social sciences, physics, biology, and mathematics. They have also been used as tactileaids, allowing blind individuals to plan and navigate their environment, thereby reducing the need for a sighted companion. Evidence suggeststhat relief maps were created for the visually disabled more than 300 years ago, toward the end of the 17th century (Eriksson, Jansson, &\nStrucel, 2003). Eriksson et al. note that the oldest extant map, which is housed in Vienna, was probably produced for Maria Theresia von\nParadis, a singer and composer who was blind. It is a standard print map, with borders, cities, and rivers produced in relief. National bordersare embroidered; rivers are shown using \ufb01nely stitched pewter thread; and cities, towns, and villages are symbolized with buttons of different\nsizes. Despite the maps' potential value, many visually impaired individuals have never explored a tactile map or other tangible graphic format(see Eriksson et al., 2003; Schiff & Foulke, 1982). Limited production methods (described below) and infrequent access to such aids have nodoubt contributed signi \ufb01cantly to this situation.\nHow might information be displayed to make it easily interpretable by hand rather than by eye? Until recently, tangible graphic displays have\ntypically consisted of static two-dimensional arrangements of raised symbols with little, if any, variation in the third dimension. Material cues\nhave rarely been used. A few examples are shown in \ufb01gure 10.6: the human digestive tract (panel A), a line graph (panel B), and a relief map of\nthe world (panel C).\nThe effective design of tangible graphic displays for the blind raises a number of important issues that relate to the inherent capabilities and\nlimitations of manual sensing, as discussed in chapters 4 and 5. General principles based on scienti \ufb01c results can be used to guide the creation\nof tangible graphic displays and to anticipate the relative success with which different graphic formats (e.g., overlays, underlays) may be used.For further information on tangible graphics, the reader should consult Schiff and Foulke (1982). A more recent booklet devoted speci \ufb01cally\nto tactile maps by Eriksson et al. (2003) provides both a practical discussion of production issues and an overview of the research anddevelopment of tactile maps.\nHow does haptic processing constrain the effective use of current static displays?

Early on, those who designed and produced tangible\ngraphic displays had little, if any, access to scienti \ufb01c information regarding human haptic processing. Of course, there was relatively little to\noffer. It is only recently that scientists have recognized that the haptic system can process highly complex information and clearly deserves tobe comprehensively studied. With limited understanding of the sense of touch per se, it is not surprising that designers typically chose toproduce tangible graphic displays as raised replicas of visual representations, inappropriately assuming that the visual and haptic systems alway s\nfunction similarly.\nAlthough the visual system can extract valuable information from edges for the purposes of recognizingApplied Aspects of Hand Function 187", "doc_id": "c914215e-bd20-42aa-98f3-ceb0187648af", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e4793ba792d2e418e85c21787a3a1a1410efb9c780a2e6efc0cdbcd1352b3359", "extra_info": {"page_label": "196", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3064, "end": 4888}, "relationships": {"1": "0d59d467-bd44-46e6-b415-a12e0ca12d43", "2": "8b770367-b90a-46b1-b7f5-9534e5dda0a4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "14b546c6-e9f1-419a-801d-124a69d6fb71": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 10.6.

First, the spatial\nacuity of the \ufb01ngertips is inferior to that of the fovea, which means that the haptic system is relatively limited in its ability to process very \ufb01ne\nspatial details. Second, static raised-line tangible graphic displays force the haptic system to process two-dimensional geometric features base d\non the information extracted by the exploratory procedure known as contour following (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987). Although contour\nfollowing is necessary for obtaining and integrating spatial details into an overall form, it is still inaccurate and unacceptably slow . The heavymemory load imposed on users restricts perceivers' ability to integrate the sequential inputs into a global spatial representation (B. Jones, 1981;Klatzky & Lederman, 2003a). Third, it is dif \ufb01cult for users to group or parse the spatially confusing two-dimensional information contained in\nraised-line displays. Fourth, although whole-hand exploration signi \ufb01cantly improves haptic object identi \ufb01cation and shape perception by\nmaking available multiple inputs distributed across the hand and by providing three-dimensional geometric information (Lederman et al.,1993; Lederman & Klatzky, 2004), such haptic information is spatially coarse compared to what is typically available to the visual system.\nInasmuch as the haptic system is seriously limited in its ability to process spatially distributed edge information, graphic representations that\ndemand the integration of precise spatial details, such as raisedline drawings of common objects (e.g., \ufb01gure 10.6A), are likely to be\napprehended poorly. Recall that Lederman et al. (1990; also see chapter 5) showed that both blindfolded and sighted subjects recognized a setof such common object depictions slowly and inaccurately. Although good performance has been achieved (e.g., Heller, Calcaterra, Burson, &Tyler, 1996), the conditions under which such levels are observed tend to be highly restrictive (e.g., limited number of stimulus objects;invariant stimulus size, orientation, and shape; categorical precuing). Practice with a speci \ufb01c exemplar can no doubt improve performance, but\nit would be more desirable ultimately if users could access an internationally accessible database of stored representations provided bydesigners from around the world.

To serve as a useful communication tool, information in a display must be accessible both quickly and accurately. This has\nnot reliably occurred with representational raised-line displays.\nIn contrast, other types of static, raised, two-dimensionaldispl ays that make l ess-precise spatialdemands on haptic processing or that do not\nrequire explicit object identi \ufb01cation may not be subject to the same limitations and can thus be quite useful. In one such example involving line\ngraphs, congenitally blind participants haptically determined the features of one or more functions on a raised-line graph (e.g., shape, slope,converging versus diverging functions, the coordinates of a point of intersection). Presumably, they capitalized on the cutaneous and coarseproprioceptive information available during manual exploration (Lederman & Campbell, 1983). Under such circumstances, there is no need to\nresort to the extensive temporal integration that is necessary for producing a complete mental representation of the overall display.\nSuggested Improvements\nAdjustmentofTwo-DimensionalDetails:Omission,Addition,andDistortion Because the haptic system is relatively imprecise at processing raised two-\ndimensional geometric details, some map designers have proposed the judicious deletion, addition, and even distortion of critical features forproper map interpretation. They suggest that such map \u201cediting \u201dmay facilitate easy access to and comprehension of information available in a\nspeci\ufb01c tactile map (e.g., Eriksson et al., 2003). For example, details that are unnecessary to the required map function may be omitted.\nImportant details that are relatively complex may be enlarged, whereas other parts of the map that are less signi \ufb01cant may be reduced in\nmagnitude to preserve a reasonable size of work space within which to explore manually. Although we do not know if these suggestions havebeen formally evaluated, the ideas seem plausible on the basis of what is now known about the nature of haptic processing. It is certainly thecase that the visualsystem can recognize caricatures of faces, as opposed to photographs of those faces, quite easil y despite the fact that thelatter contain more \u201caccurate information \u201d(Gombrich, 1972, 1977).\nAdding Three-Dimensional Structure Structural information in the display may be enhanced by introducing full three-dimensional geometric\nvariation wherever possible. In this way, the perceiver can capitalize on the valuable geometric cues made available by grasping, the exploratoryprocedure known as enclosure (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987), whereby the palm and \ufb01ngers conform to the object-s contours. As we have\npreviously noted, the elimination of such information by rigidly splinting the \ufb01ngers impairs haptic object recognition. Under such limited\nconditions of haptic exploration, the geometric information normally provided by the proprioceptive system is unavailable (Klatzky et al.,1993; see chapter 3).\nA recent technological innovation known as a haptic interface will be described in detail in the subsequent section on haptic interfaces. These\ncomplex electromechanical systems provide force feedback to users as they explore objects and surfaces within a real or virtual work space bymoving a probe. Most of the current systems deliver point-contact force feedback, which is experienced as resistance to movement overvirtual objects and surfaces whose properties and locations are computationally modeled. The goal of such systems is to create a perceptualexperience akin to feeling real objects and surfaces with a rigid probe.\nHaptic interfaces offer the tangible graphic designer the possibility of creating virtual three-dimensional displays that may ultimately improve\nthe identi \ufb01cation of objects, their properties, and their spatial layout beyond what is currently achievable with static raised two-dimensional\ndisplays (Kilchenman-O'Malley & Goldfarb, 2002).", "doc_id": "26583f28-e19a-4d0a-9cac-00a60de0715e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b06c2b3fbc26efb82ed1ae42cdb7a84e7a187930d710b4e9a2d465499750aef3", "extra_info": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4098}, "relationships": {"1": "c38a8de8-fa17-4476-aa7c-39e54731d2e4", "3": "af3b93de-e831-4d6a-a60e-e534b2a32bd1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "af3b93de-e831-4d6a-a60e-e534b2a32bd1": {"__data__": {"text": "section on haptic interfaces.

Nevertheless, performance may still be somewhat limited, for reasons discussed in chapter8 (Kirkpatrick & Douglas, 2002; Lederman & Klatzky, 2004).\nA possible solution involves the use of multiple sensors and actuators in a display, which would provide haptic feedback distributed within or\nacross the hand(s) (Burdea & Coiffet, 2003). Current multicontact systems (e.g., gloves) are costly and cumbersome to operate, thus reducingthe effectiveness of the proprioceptive feedback normally available during hand movements (Bouzit, Popescu, Burdea, & Boian, 2002; Klatzkyet al., 1993; Lederman & Klatzky, 2004).

The judicious addition of redundant variation in virtual\nmaterialproperties in a haptic interface may further enhance the ef \ufb01cacy of current raised-line two-dimensional graphic displays of objects\n(Holmes, Hughes, & Jansson, 1998; Klatzky et al., 1989; Lederman et al., 1996; C.

Any\nsymbolin the displ ay that is not a target becomes a distractor, or haptic \u201cnoise,\u201dand too many distractors substantially interfere with\nprocessing the target symbol. One method that has been proposed to reduce clutter on graphs (see \ufb01gure 10.7) involves the use of an underlay,\na sheet that presents valuable spatial reference information (e.g., a grid) beneath and physically separate from the main display (Lederman &\nCampbell, 1983). By freely exploring the graph with the preferred hand, the blind user can effectively obtain relatively simple spatial layout\ninformation about the raised-line functions in a reduced-noise environment (i.e., high signal/noise ratio). When more precise coordinateinformation is desired (e.g., about points of intersections), the grid underlay is used in conjunction with the graph above. Once again,participants use their preferred hand to explore the relatively uncluttered display on the top sheet (e.g., to locate a point of intersection\nFigure 10.7.

It thus contrasts with\nthe dif \ufb01culty of coordinating the use of one hand on top of the other, as required when using an overlay haptically . Indeed, working with\noverlays is less effective than with underlays, to which blind users adapt quite effectively despite having no experience with this new technique.\nAlternately, with the promising advent of computer-controlled force-feedback systems (discussed in detail below), the user should be able to\nadd or omit background information easily as desired. Such electromechanical displays could also vibrate selected targets, thereby offering anew and potentially effective method for dynamically increasing signal-to-noise ratios.\nChoosingDisplaySymbols Much like those who design visual graphic displays, tangible graphic designers face several critical problems. The\n\ufb01rst\u2014symbol tangibility, or the ability to differentiate effectively raised symbols by touch \u2014critically affects the optimal selection of symbols\nfor tangible graphic displays. The symbols (point, line, and area) cannot be too small because of limitations in tactile spatial acuity (see chapter\n4). Unfortunately , the solution does not lie in increasing symbol size without limit because of the relatively small haptic work space in front ofthe body. Rather, to minimize clutter in the display, the smallest usable size should be selected based on what is now known about tactile spatialacuity thresholds.\nThe second problem concerns symbol meaningfulness. To reduce the time needed to identify a symbol from a legend, whenever possible it is\ndesirable to use the symbol's physical structure to re \ufb02ect its iconic meaning. An excellent example is provided by Schiff, Kaufer, and Mosak\n(1966), who designed a raised saw-toothed line to represent intended direction on a map. Schiff et al. avoided choosing a raised two-\ndimensional version of an arrow because a small arrowhead can be particularly dif \ufb01cult to resolve by hand. As shown in \ufb01gure 10.8, moving\nFigure 10.8. A raised-line symbol used to portray direction.

In contrast, moving one's \ufb01nger\nalong the line to the left produces a rougher sensation, which is meant to represent the unintended direction.\nCapitalizing on the value of three-dimensional contour for the haptic recognition of common objects (Klatzky et al., 1985), Lambert and\nLederman (1989) designed a set of three-dimensional symbols (e.g., men's and women's washrooms, telephone, cafeteria) for use on tangiblemaps of building interiors.

The added three-dimensional structural cues proved effective in reducing the length oftime taken to identify the symbol relative to other symbols that were tangible but without added meaning.\nSymbolStandardization The standardization of a \ufb01xed set of highly differentiable symbols is potentially desirable because it may reduce how\nmuch the visually impaired must learn about each new display.

It is therefore doubtful that complete standardization is achievable, although blindindividuals can spontaneously produce symbols similar to those used conventionally by sighted individuals when generating their own raised-line drawings (Kennedy, 1993).\nFigure-GroundandHapticProcessingofSpatialInformation Both the visualand auditory systems demonstrate strong \ufb01gure-ground organization\ntogether with a number of principles of perceptual grouping (Bregman, 1990; Goldstein, 2002). It is likely that similar or related processes areof criticalimportance to the effective design and use of tangibl e graphic displ ays. To date, however, we know of no comprehensive body of\nresearch that has systematically focused on how the haptic system organizes and spatially groups objects within a display.\nOne intriguing suggestion relates to \ufb01gure-ground organization, a fundamentalcharacteristic of earl y visualprocessing (Gol dstein, 2002). In\nbrief, blind children have demonstrated an ability to haptically separate \ufb01gure from ground when interpreting a simple raised-line contour as\nthe pro \ufb01le of a face (Kennedy & Domander, 1984). The results suggest that \ufb01gure-ground relations depicted in a tangible graphic display\naffect the accuracy of haptic recognition of facial features in a manner that is similar to pictorial displays that require visual exploration.Understanding the processes that underlie haptic spatial organization in sighted, blindfolded, and blind individuals would seem critical for thei r\nepiste-mological value and for the effective design of tangible graphic displays for the blind.\nProvidingMultisensoryCues A\ufb01nalpotentialdesign improvement is to provide additionalredundant or compl ementary information to other\nfunctioning sensory systems in the form of a multimodal display. In the case of raised two-dimensional tangible graphic displays for the\nvisually impaired, the auditory system is the most obvious choice. We note the success with which Yu and Brewster (2002) used two hapticinterfaces, the high-cost PHANTOM (SensAble Technologies) and the low-cost WingMan (Logitech) force-feedback mouse (for furtherdetails, see the section on haptic interfaces below) to render a two-dimensional bar chart either haptically or multimodally. The accuracy of\nunimodaland bimodalperformance with each device was very simil ar for a number of performance measures. In addition, the bimodalcondition was signi \ufb01cantly superior to either unimodal condition. These encouraging results con \ufb01rm that it is possible to use a cheaper haptic\ninterface to produce a functional tangible graphic display. Pie charts should work well with such methods, but other more-complex forms ofgraphic display (e.g., multiple intersecting line graphs) will pose additional problems and therefore should be designed and evaluated separately .\nProduction Methods\nIt is important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of a tangible graphic display is signi \ufb01cantly affected by the particular production method\nadopted. Until recently, tangible graphic displays have involved static presentations that are constructed in a variety of labor-intensive ways,which make further alterations dif \ufb01cult (Gill, 1982).\nSome early methods included the following.

Until recently, tangible graphic displays have involved static presentations that are constructed in a variety of labor-intensive ways,which make further alterations dif \ufb01cult (Gill, 1982).\nSome early methods included the following. One-of-a-kind masters have often been produced by spatially arranging and subsequently gluing\nvarious materials (e.g., string, wires, beads, sandpaper) to a base surface. These methods are time consuming, although they do allow the\ndesigner to capitalize on the haptic effectiveness with which material cues can be processed. Tangible graphics have also been created by\nmanually producing an engraved, left-right reversed, female mold on thin metal foil. The metal sheet is then turned over to make accessible araised display with the proper left-right spatial relations. Since the 1970s, it has also been possible to bypass the intermediate engraving stage bydrawing directly on plastic \u201cswellpaper, \u201da material consisting of millions of tiny capsules \ufb01lled with alcohol suspended in an emulsion paintlike\nsubstance that covers a backing paper. The graphic display is initially produced on the swellpaper and then exposed to heat using a specializedcopy machine. The black areas on the paper expand with heat, leaving the remaining areas \ufb02at, to create a black, raised two-dimensional image\nthat can be manually explored. The technique has become popular because original192 Applied Aspects of Hand Function", "doc_id": "cc894603-16cf-4b0f-bfc0-0c6616fe1994", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea95de1e387e5aea6338b56d721da8ed476be46dc0bf626ae293e2ebe392787b", "extra_info": {"page_label": "201", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3167, "end": 4785}, "relationships": {"1": "71373d36-bad5-4bf2-9bd3-3fa3b4a713db", "2": "125898c9-a533-4073-be34-861d8ea98268"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fc2a84d-acb0-4793-bdbf-36dfe39abf54": {"__data__": {"text": "raised drawings and multiple copies may be easily produced with this technique. Unfortunately, the height cannot be precisely controlled.\nFlexible plastic copies of a male master (e.g., a metal foil, epoxyresin master of the laminated female copy) have also been generated using a\nvacuum-forming machine. Although relatively easy to use, the vacuum-formed copies are even more imprecise than those produced withswellpaper.\nIn principle, the electromechanical generation of two-dimensional tangible graphic displays with large arrays of actuators is appealing; however ,\nthe cost of production and the limited reliability of such devices place such a system beyond the reach of most users. To reduce the size of thedisplay, it has been suggested from time to time that the spatially extended physical display (e.g., map) be replaced with a digitally stored image.Much like the Optacon, the reading device for the blind described in chapter 4, the user could access the virtual display sequentially by moving\na miniature camera over the surface of the map. A vibrotactile array of pins could present the portion sensed by the camera to the index \ufb01nger\nof the other hand, updating the information displayed over time as the camera was moved across the virtual display. It would be even moredesirable if the use of a second hand was entirely eliminated by combining a miniature camera and tactile array stimulator within a singledevice. An example of this technology is the VirTouch Mouse (http:www.skerpel.com/mouse.htm), a device that works similarly to theOptacon but that delivers information to two adjacent \ufb01ngers via a pair of matrices of vibrating displays. Each display consists of 4 \u00d74\nstimulating pins that rise and fall as the user moves the mouse across the display. It remains to be seen whether such a simple device used in\nconjunction with tangible graphic displays will produce a notable improvement in performance. Merely widening the tactile \ufb01eld of view to\ninclude two, as opposed to one, \ufb01ngers does not improve the recognition of raised two-dimensional Braille characters, tactile maps, or\ndepictions of common objects (Lappin & Foulke, 1973; Loomis et al., 1991). In contrast, distributing cutaneous and proprioceptive\ninformation across the whole hand does improve the identi \ufb01cation of geometrically de \ufb01ned three-dimensionalcommon objects (Jansson &\nMonaci, 2003, 2004; Klatzky et al., 1993), presumably because the palm and/or \ufb01ngers can simultaneously mold to a considerable portion, if\nnot all, of the object's contours.\nTo end this section, we would like to brie \ufb02y mention the advent of a number of three-dimensionalrapid prototyping technol ogies, such as\nstereolithography, which build plastic parts or objects a layer at a time by tracing a laser beam on the surface of a vat of liquid photopolymer.With the development of these new technologies, there now exist accurate and ef \ufb01cient ways of creating and copying three-dimensional\nstructures, which offer promise in the construction of tangible graphic displays.\nA System for Denominating Banknotes by Touch\nBlind individuals are seriously limited in their ability to use banknotes in their daily \ufb01nancialtransactions with individual s in the service\nindustries, such as bank clerks and retail salespeople.

L. Reed et al., 1990), blind users successfully learned to use this code within a matter of minutes and with well over 90% accuracy.\nHaptic Interfaces\nHaptic interfaces are devices that present tactile and force feedback to a human operator who is interacting with a real or simulated object via a\ncomputer. They may enable a user to make contact with an object in the environment, to feel the object's properties (e.g., texture, compliance,or shape), or to manipulate the object directly (Biggs & Srinivasan, 2002b; Durlach & Mavor, 1994). These interfaces may be \u201cmasters \u201dthat\ncontrol slave devices, such as robotic arms (telerobotics), or they may provide a means of interacting with a computer-generated virtualenvironment (e.g., modelof the eye; Hunter, Jones, Sagar, Lafontaine, & Hunter, 1995). The interaction between the operator and the robot orvirtual world is bidirectional, with either position or force being measured at the operator's hand and either force or position fed back via a\ncomputer to the operator. Usually, position (or velocity) is the input to the control loop and forces are fed back to the operator. Because there\nis bidirectional interaction between the user and the virtual world, this type of interface is fundamentally different from feedback systems usingother modalities, such as vision and audition, as they are unidirectional.\nHaptic displays are usually designed to be held or worn on the hand, and so the design and implementation of these interfaces is critically\ndependent on having a basic understanding of the human haptic system and how it functions. Characteristics of human performance, such asthe absolute threshold for detecting a force or vibratory stimulus, changes in force amplitude or vibration frequency that are perceptible, or thestiffness required for a solid object to appear rigid, must be known in order for the haptic display to be useful and effective. Since the 1990s,the development of these devices has led to a resurgence of interest in sensory and motor studies of the human hand (Durlach & Mavor,\n1994). It has also resulted in a highly interdisciplinary community of researchers that includes computer scientists involved in developing\nalgorithms for haptic rendering, engineers designing and building haptic displays, and experimental psychologists and physiologists evaluatinghuman performance when using these systems.\nThe haptic interfaces used in teleoperation or in virtual or simulated environments have matured from simple, ground-based, 2 degrees-of-\nfreedom joysticks and cumbersome hand controllers to more dexterous interfaces that are body based and that present information to the\ufb01ngertips or to the whole hand (Burdea, 1996; Burdea & Coiffet, 2003). The use of haptic devices for presenting the physical properties of\nobjects, such as their mass or surface texture, becomes critical in those applications where the user actively manipulates the simulated or realworld or where visual information is limited, such as in undersea environments, in space, or inside the human body. In these manipulation\ntasks, information provided haptically about an object's rigidity, mass, compliance, friction, or surface characteristics results in greater rea lism\nand assists task performance as re \ufb02ected by faster completion times and decreased error rates (Hannaford & Wood, 1989; Howe &\nKontarinis, 1992). The improvement in performance observed when force and tactile feedback are added to an interface is not limited to themanipulation of robotic devices, but also occurs with more simple systems, such as graphical user interfaces. For example, target acquisitionhas been found to be faster if tactil e feedback is provided by a computer mouse, in addition to the normalvisualfeedback of cursor position\non the computer screen (Akamatsu, MacKenzie, & Hasbroucq, 1995; Akamatsu, Sato, & MacKenzie, 1994).\nAnother more recent \ufb01eld of application of haptic", "doc_id": "271f2aee-ec47-4bc9-a038-582c24707070", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "79a4ba83d589f1a8dc09197a72642ad31a87eb86e1eabc8f82be4ec76139e2cf", "extra_info": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4084}, "relationships": {"1": "65b554b5-57bf-4f79-904d-5374fd996068", "3": "f9ba8ec5-e93d-440b-ab85-67317d264b1b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9ba8ec5-e93d-440b-ab85-67317d264b1b": {"__data__": {"text": "or surface characteristics results in greater rea lism\nand assists task performance as re \ufb02ected by faster completion times and decreased error rates (Hannaford & Wood, 1989; Howe &\nKontarinis, 1992).

An alternative mode of informing the operator of an\nemergency has considerable appeal in these contexts. This could be a thermal (Jones & Berris, 2003) or vibrotactile cue that functions as analert (Hale & Stanney, 2004) and because of its novelty would be attended to, in much the same way as a vibrating cell phone or watch attractsthe user's attention.

One early application of haptic interfaces to scienti \ufb01c visualization was in the study of molecular docking, in which\nthe objective was to minimize the binding energy of two molecules by correctly positioning and orienting the smaller molecule with respect tothe larger (Ouh-young, Beard, & Brooks, 1989). The Argonne mechanical arm was used to present the simulated forces of a molecularinteraction between a drug molecule attempting to \u201cdock\u201donto a protein molecule, and biochemists attempted to \ufb01nd the potentialenergy\nminimum in a sixdimensionalspace. It was found that, by using the force displ ay, subjects were twice as fast at \ufb01nding the zero force position\nthan with a visual display alone. More recently, the PHANTOM haptic interface has been used to control the probe of an atomic forcemicroscope (AFM). In this application, the operator pushes a nanoscale particle along a surface and can feel when the probe slips off the\nparticle.\nThe quality of a haptic interface is generally interpreted in terms of the range of haptic sensations and percepts that can be presented to the\nuser, such as hard surfaces, textures, geometry, surface deformations, and compliance, and the resolution and mechanical bandwidth of theforce display (Lawrence, Pao, Salada, & Dougherty, 1996). These are a function of the components that comprise the interface (e.g., sensors,dampers, actuators) and the overall system's bandwidth, which in turn depends on computational and transmission delays. In terms of theirphysicalcon \ufb01guration, a haptic interface can be a computer mouse (Akamatsu et al., 1994), a pen-based pantograph (Hayward, 1995), a stylus\n(Buttolo & Hannaford, 1995; Massie & Salisbury, 1994), a thimble (Massie & Salisbury, 1994), a glove (Burdea, Zhuang, Roskos, Silver, &\nLangrana, 1992; Caldwell, Kocak, & Anderson, 1995), or an exoskeleton (Bergamasco et al., 1994). A summary of some of these devices and\ntheir properties is presented in table 10.1. It is surprising to note, given this diversity of con \ufb01gurations of haptic interfaces, that relatively little\nresearch has been done on what is the optimal form or work space of an interface that is controlled by the hand. One early study in humanmanualcontrolreported that it was easier to controla joysticktype device if it was hel d between the thumb and index \ufb01nger as compared to\nbeing manipulated solely by the thumb (Hammerton & Tickner, 1966). With the range of computer and robotic interface devices nowavailable, including thimbles, styluses, gloves, trackballs, and exoskeletons, it would be fruitful to explore more fully the costs and bene \ufb01ts\nassociated with these different interface designs.\nThe term haptic device is often used to describe two types of interfaces, namely, tactile and forcefeedback displays, which differ in terms of the\ninputs or feedback that they provide to the user and in the hardware used in their fabrication (see Burdea & Coiffet, 2003). In terms of the\nde\ufb01nition of haptics provided in chapter 1, a tactile display is not a haptic device as it provides tactile but not kinesthetic inputs to the user.\nKinesthetic inputs will, however, arise from the operator if the display is actively moved by hand and \ufb01nger movements generated by the user.\nForce-feedback displays provide both tactile and kinesthetic feedback to the user.

In contrast, tactile-feedback\ndevices usually have pin arrays, vibrators, or, less commonly, air jets or bellows, that stimulate the skin. Force-feedback systems can providecoarse information to a human operator via a device such as a joystick, which is held within the palm of the hand, or more precise force\ninformation using a number of points of contact in the hand, for example, by an exoskeleton worn on the hand (Hasser & Massie, 1998).\nTactile-feedback devices typically apply stimuli to the \ufb01ngertip using arrays of pins that apply forces perpendicular to the skin and are actuated\nby piezoelectric crystals, shape memory alloy wires, solenoids, or pneumatics.

These commercially available devices were clearly designed and built for different applications. The iFeel mouse was designed to assist\nin navigation on computer screens by providing an additionalinput to the user who typical l y rel ies on visualand auditory feedback to con \ufb01rm\nthat an action has been executed. The tactile cues from the mouse do not require the user to look at the device and, with further developments,offer the possibility of having different tactile cues associated with different menu options or icons. Users are, however, constrained to keeptheir hands on the desk in contact with the mouse in order to receive feedback. In contrast, the CyberTouch glove was developed for use invirtual environment applications and allows signi \ufb01cant motion of the hand. The con \ufb01guration of the hand itself is recorded from sensors\nmounted over the \ufb01nger joints and wrist and is then transmitted to the host computer. These measurements are used to drive the position and\ncon\ufb01guration of a virtualhand presented to the user on a visualdispl ay. The six vibrotactil e actuators attached to the gl ove are activated\nwhenever the virtualhand interacts with virtualobjects, so they provide information about which \ufb01ngers are in contact with the object. Each\nactuator can be individually programmed to vary the intensity of the vibration on the hand (Immersion Corporation, 2004). At present, these\ntactile displays deliver rather simple vibrotactile inputs to the hand at single frequencies that are within the range of maximal sensitivities(Bolanowski et al., 1988). The use of patterns of vibrotactile stimuli to convey information about objects or events in the environment holdspromise and awaits more sophisticated controlschemes that can controlthe characteristics of the inputs del ivered to individualactuators.Applied Aspects of Hand Function 197", "doc_id": "24793edf-28f0-4c3b-9b67-5da88ae6f603", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "80149a9d4e5f12ff4312aa6128e1558af3170a3b588d3bf761b7ab225985853d", "extra_info": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3494}, "relationships": {"1": "73dbcd9d-6e5a-44e1-99ed-ab3b4eb29f7f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffdf3f9a-1f79-4939-a751-6eaefb4f68c7": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 10.10.

Nevertheless, the results of psychophysical research\noffer promising scienti \ufb01c support for the value of displaying spatially distributed forces to the \ufb01ngertips. For example, Lederman and Klatzky\n(1999) evaluated user performance on a battery of simple sensory and more complex perceptual tests when spatially distributed informationwas either presented to the distalpad of the thumb or index \ufb01nger or eliminated by requiring participants to wear a rigid sheath molded to \ufb01t\nover the same region. The results indicated that two-point touch and pressure thresholds were both substantially impaired by the absence of\nspatially distributed \ufb01nger deformation patterns, and detecting the orientation of a raised bar was at chance level. Roughness perception (as\nmeasured by magnitude estimation and two-alternative, forced-choice discrimination procedures) was only moderately impaired, suggestingthat vibratory cues could still be used relatively effectively . Finally, detecting the presence or absence of a simulated mass embedded withinsimulated tissue with 75% accuracy required the mass size to be approximately 44% larger (i.e., 6.6 mm) when the spatially distributed forcecues were absent as opposed to present (i.e., 4.6 mm). Clearly, the availability of tactile cues on the \ufb01ngertip improved performance across a\nbroad spectrum of sensory and perceptualtasks.\nForce-Feedback Interfaces\nForce-feedback devices differ from tactile-feedback devices in that they are usually larger and heavier due to the force output requirements of\nthe actuators. These devices may be attached to the hand and arm in the form of an exoskeleton or mounted on the \ufb02oor or a desk, such as a\njoystick. The latter interfaces are termed earth-grounded, off-the-body systems and typically have fewer degrees of freedom than doexoskeletal devices.

The WingMan Force 3-D joystick (Logitech, 2004) is a relatively simple force-feedback device with 3 degrees of freedom, 2of which have force feedback that can produce a maximum force of 3.3 N. It was designed for use with computer games and so provides joltsor springlike forces that simulate collisions and inertial accelerations. A much more sophisticated force-feedback device, which is used in both\nindustrial and research environments, is the PHANTOM, originally designed and built by Massie and Salisbury (1994) and now produced bySensAble Technologies. There are four different PHANTOM models, which vary with respect to their force-feedback work space, stiffness,and motor force. The premium models (see \ufb01gure 10.10) provide 3 degrees of freedom of positionalsensing and 6 degrees of freedom of\nforce feedback. The interface has a serial feedback arm that ends with a stylus that is held in the hand (SensAble Technologies, 2004). Force-\nfeedback devices, such as the PHANTOM, are used in industry and research for virtual assembly, virtual maintenance path planning (i.e.,determining the optimal path for performing maintenance operations in accessible structures such as airplane engines), molecular modeling,and teleoperation.\nThe PHANTOM is a point-contact device and so assumes a point contact between the simulated probe and the virtual object. Point-contact\ndisplays are subject to the limitations previously raised concerning the absence of spatially distributed forces on the \ufb01ngers (e.g., Lederman &\nKlatzky, 1999). In addition, as users are limited to a single point of contact when using the PHANTOM, unless two are used to grasp an\nobject, each object must be explored serially in order to determine its geometry. We have previously discussed the substantial decline in haptic\nobject recognition when using a rigid probe, which serves as a simple model for point-contact haptic interfaces. Such displays restrict the tactile\n(net force and vibratory cues) and kinesthetic information available to the user during manual exploration because only one extended \u201c\ufb01nger\u201d\nis in effect being used. Such limited manual exploration imposes severe constraints on the temporal integration of sequentially extracted inputs,as previously discussed in chapter 5 and in the current chapter (see the section above on tangible graphics). Under these conditions of manualexploration, recognition accuracy declines markedly, and response times are unacceptably long.\nThe\ufb01nal type of device that is primarily used in virtual environment applications is force-feedback gloves that have both sensors to measure\nthe position of the \ufb01nger joints and actuators mounted over the \ufb01ngers so that simulated forces can be controlled independently at each\nactuator. The CyberGrasp glove (Immersion Corporation, 2004) shown in \ufb01gure 10.10 is one such system; it has 22 sensors to measure the\nposition of the \ufb01ngers and the wrist and 5 actuators mounted on the \ufb01ngertips. The torques that are generated by these actuators are\ntransmitted to the user's \ufb01ngertips via a system of cables and a mechanical exoskeleton, which is worn on top of a CyberGlove that houses the\nposition sensors.

Support for using force-feedback gloves in preference topoint-contact devices comes from experimental studies that have demonstrated that whole-hand exploration is best for haptically recognizingreal objects, in terms of both speed and accuracy (Lederman & Klatzky, 2004).

As\ndescribed in chapters 6 and 8, instrumented gloves such as the CyberGlove (Immersion Corporation, 2004), which measure the position of\neach joint of the hand, have made it possible to analyze the temporal and spatial coordination between the \ufb01ngers during multidigit grasping\n(Santello & Soechting, 1998). This work has demonstrated that there are consistent co-variations between the angular excursions of the \ufb01ngers\nas the hand reaches to grasp an object and that the number of degrees of freedom that is independently controlled is much smaller than the\nnumber available (Schieber & Santello, 2004). The addition of robust force sensors to these gloves so that both the kinetics and kinematics of\nhand movements could be studied simultaneously would provide further valuable information about the coordinative control of handmovements. Glove-based haptic displays are also being used to evaluate the progress of therapy used to treat disorders affecting the hand(Burdea, 1996). As new materials are developed that can be used as both sensors and actuators, there will be additional opportunities to furtherour understanding of how the hand is used to sense and act on the environment.\nExploring Art by Touch\nThe Exploratorium is a scienti \ufb01c museum in San Francisco that was designed some years ago to encourage children and adults alike to gain\nvaluable hands-on experience as a means of helping people to better understand the scienti \ufb01c phenomena on display. Indeed, many museums\nnow include highly instructive hands-on presentations. However, the geodesic tactile dome, designed in 1971, is of particular interest to those\nwho wish to experience the somewhat unsettling, always fascinating experience of exploring the sense of touch in total darkness. The observer\nmust crawl, climb, and squeeze through different rooms and openings whose surfaces are covered with various materials. The tactile domeoffers an excellent opportunity for participants to become manually aware of the concrete world and its varied properties in a way that isdenied when vision is concurrently available.\nThose who visit art museums and galleries are usually prevented from touching the artistic works on display. Unfortunately, the constant wear\nand the acid deposited as a result of manual contact can cause signi \ufb01cant damage to the art. The aesthetic experiences of those who are visually\nimpaired are thus especially con \ufb01ned by restrictions on touching. However, even viewers with intact vision may bene \ufb01t from haptic\nexploration. Over the years, occasional special art shows have invited the viewer to \u201cplease touch! \u201dThere now seems to be growing\ninternational interest in making art accessible to both nonsighted and sighted visitors through nonretinocentric means, including the sense of\ntouch and other modalities.

She began this\nwork by initially observing and learning from people with visual impairments as they explored works of art by touch. Since then, she hasproduced tactile/visual sculptures and exhibited them in art museums. When permitted, she also provided blindfolds and guide rails for\nviewers to explore art solely through their sense of touch. The scale of her sculptures is deliberately adapted to the human body. Thus, some\npieces are small enough to be enclosed by the two hands; larger ones are contained within the haptic space of the arms' reach; \ufb01nally, still larger\nones de \ufb01ne spaces through which the observer must climb or walk. Based on careful observation as to how the sense of touch normally\nfunctions, both on its own and when compared to vision, Driscoll has chosen to emphasize the importance of material properties and qualitiesin her work by creating sculptures out of a variety of durable, sensuous materials, such as wood, stone, metal, leather, and rope (e.g., \ufb01gure\n10.13). For Driscoll, active manual exploration of the contours, surfaces, and materials of her works plays a critical role in the aesthetic\nexperience of the observer, thus capitalizing on what we have learned in chapter 5 about the contributions of manual exploration to hapticperception. In addition, her sculptures tend toward abstract rather than representational imagery. This preference for abstract interpretationseems most appropriate, given the \ufb01ndings discussed in chapter 5 that highlight the considerable dif \ufb01culty with which observers can perceive\nand identify the geometric properties of realobjects and their spatiall ayout by hand.\nSuch an approach calls into question the validity of R\u00e9v\u00e9sz's (1950) earlier rejection of haptic aesthetics in those born blind. His own\ncomparisons of the visual and haptic systems in terms of normal function led him to conclude that the congenitally blind are incapable ofhaving an aesthetic appreciation of sculpture: \u201cThe haptic process is not \ufb01t to ful \ufb01ll the conditions for an aesthetic approach \u201d(p. 169). R\u00e9v\u00e9sz\nclaimed that the blind observer merely attempts to recognize the form of the piece by touch. But since he limited his theoretical and practical\ndiscussions primarily to consideration of representational sculptures, it is not surprising that he arrived at this conclusion. Driscoll's approa ch\nwould seem to offer a more promising avenue to the aesthetic appreciation and production of the plastic arts by both blind and sightedpersons as mediated through the sense of touch.Applied Aspects of Hand Function 201", "doc_id": "d13ea35d-c6c0-48a7-b256-a6c1bc94b742", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6b25f296355dc297b5c3ec2d5bc65b046253285691739163d8db438fae62cd95", "extra_info": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3211}, "relationships": {"1": "99fdd283-7062-4705-841e-3b2a07d703ec"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d49c1b9-c730-4164-b0c9-a0bc6918247b": {"__data__": {"text": "Figure 10.12.

Together, these four categories have permitted us to\nencompass the extensive range of activities considered in this review . They have also provided a structure for analyzing the factors thatin\ufb02uence human manualperformance. Any number of categories coul d have been used to distinguish different aspects of hand function, but\nfour seemed to be the minimum number of categories that worked effectively .\nAt the sensory end of the continuum, the hand together with the central nervous system is capable of processing a variety of tactile inputs in\nthe absence of any \ufb01nger movements (i.e., tactile sensing). Based on this sensory information, people experience a wealth of subjective manual\nsensations that vary in their quality, intensity, and acuity. It is also possible to perceive coarse variations in the properties of objects, particu larly\nwhen there is relative motion between the skin and surface of the object. However, active haptic sensing offers many more cues about theexternal world. By selecting the appropriate exploratory procedure(s) (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987), people can choose not only the type(s) ofinformation but also the appropriate level(s) of precision they require in order to achieve a particular goal. When either tactile or active hapticsensing is involved, the hand functions as the primary sensing organ for touch. In contrast, when the hand acts as a tool, its function isprincipally motoric, despite the demonstrated need for sensory information to achieve successful performance. This close interplay between\nthe sensory and motor functions of the hand in \ufb02uences how we reach to grasp an object and then manipulate it. In the absence of sensory\nfeedback from cutaneous mechanoreceptors, reaching movements take longer, and once contact is made with the object the forces producedat the \ufb01ngertips cannot be controlled precisely and so the object often slips between the \ufb01ngers (Gentilucci et al., 1997; Johansson & Cole,\n1994).

These non-prehensile skilled movements are usually characterized in terms of their speed and consecutiveness.\nHowever, analyses of \ufb01nger movements during typing and piano playing reveal that they are not strictly independent and serial and that they\ntoo rely on sensory feedback from muscles and skin to prevent errors in movement trajectories (Gordon & Soechting, 1995).\nIt is important to keep in mind that, in all of these activities, from tactile sensing to non-prehensile movements, the hand serves dual functions\nas a movable sensory organ and as a vehicle for motor activity. Indeed, in many situations, the hand must play both roles. For example, if we\nare hungry, we may reach into a bowl to select a piece of fruit. First, we squeeze it gently to determine its ripeness; if satis \ufb01ed that it is indeed\nedible, we then pick it up and bring it to our mouth. It is even possible to perform these two sensory and motor functions simultaneously.\nConclusions\nSince the 1980s, interest in studying the sensory and motor performance of the human hand has resurged in part stimulated by the\ndevelopment of dexterous robotic hands and haptic interfaces. For those interested in understanding the sensory neurophysiological and\nbehavioral bases of somatosensory processing, the study of hand function is critical. Not only is the hand an important body site for studying\ntactile sensing, but it is undoubtedly paramount for active haptic sensing.\nTactile sensing with the hand is strongly in \ufb02uenced by the properties of the peripheral somatosensory system, particularly with respect to the\nstructure, density, distribution, and sensitivities of the different mechanoreceptor and thermoreceptor populations in glabrous and hairy skin.\nIn the case of tactile pattern recognition, performance appears to be set by such peripheral factors (Johnson & Phillips, 1981).\nIn contrast, when judging concrete objects, their properties, and the spaces they occupy, humans are most effective when they actively control\ntheir manual exploration. Systematic hand-movement patterns or exploratory procedures (Lederman & Klatzky, 1987) make the sensory\ninformation available. However, these must be selected and executed as appropriate to (1) the task (e.g., object recognition, object\nidenti\ufb01cation, or the perception of a speci \ufb01c object property, such as texture or shape); (2) the type of object (e.g., its size relative to the\nexploring hand or \ufb01nger, whether it is de \ufb01ned by single or multiple attributes); and (3) the mode of exploration (e.g., bare hand, probe). What\ncurrent research highlights is the fact that to understand fully the bases of sensory hand function, it is important to recognize that manual\nexploration necessarily constrains the information that is made available and thus, ultimately, one's performance. A random choice of handmovement pattern(s) does not guarantee success. Rather, EP selection serves as a funnel that determines the amount, quality, and resolution ofthe sensory information available. To use a simplistic example, if the only way to judge the weight of an object that is \ufb01xed to a supporting base\nis by rubbing the \ufb01ngers back and forth across the object's surfaces with a lateral-motion EP, the observer will fail (Lederman & Klatzky,\n1987). By molding the hand to whatever contours are accessible using an enclosure EP , performance will likely improve because that EP\nprovides coarse information about object size, which is usually correlated with weight. Nevertheless, performance will not be optimal. Toachieve this level, the observer must be able to lift (preferably heft) the object away from its supporting surface using an unsupported-holdingEP, which provides the most precise information about weight.\nFor those interested in understanding the neurophysiological, biomechanical, and cognitive mechanisms involved in human", "doc_id": "00ccc4c7-7854-415d-8e3b-1497ef82ab29", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "266c71b7281105780ddc1ad810001e9f127917fb6cd635f2716b3d555e74a437", "extra_info": {"page_label": "214", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3890}, "relationships": {"1": "6395019e-3992-4939-a6fe-65e2018daa16", "3": "eb5c8d7d-a055-458d-9861-b1538e64d315"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb5c8d7d-a055-458d-9861-b1538e64d315": {"__data__": {"text": "example, if the only way to judge the weight of an object that is \ufb01xed to a supporting base\nis by rubbing the \ufb01ngers back and forth across the object's surfaces with a lateral-motion EP, the observer will fail (Lederman & Klatzky,\n1987).

First, the complexity of its anatomical structure with morethan 20 degrees of freedom of movement poses an exciting challenge in terms of understanding how the central nervous system controls sucha complex mechanical system.

These two issues have been addressed in a range of studies that have analyzed multidigit\ngrasping and single-digit control (e.g., Mason et al., 2001; Santello & Soechting, 1998; Soechting & Flanders, 1997).

Hence there is a simpli \ufb01cation of the computationaltask during most manualactivities. This is re \ufb02ected in the synergistic action of the\nmuscles of the hand during reaching-to-grasp movements when changes in \ufb01nger joint angles are synchronized in time as the hand is\npreshaped to \ufb01t the object's dimensions (Gentilucci et al., 1991; Santello et al., 2002). As the object is grasped, the grip forces are synchronized\nin time across a variety of grasp conditions, so that they too are not independently controlled (Johansson & Cole, 1994). However, should it benecessary, the motor controlsystem can rapidl y adjust the trajectory of the \ufb01ngers or forces produced by a single digit (Edin et al., 1992;\nPaulignan, Jeannerod, et al., 1991; Paulignan, MacKenzie, et al., 1991).\nThe analyses of keyboard skills, such as piano playing and typing, have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the\nlearning and retention of manual skills. This research has revealed what features of performance change as one progresses from being a novice\nto an expert and how , in these essentially serial motor tasks, so much of the planning and programming of \ufb01nger movements occurs in\nparallel. The novice typist is primarily limited by cognitive constraints (i.e., processing text, identifying key positions, planning \ufb01nger\nmovements), whereas the main restriction affecting skilled performance is motoric. For the expert, the key variables that in \ufb02uence the speed\nwith which letters are typed are the location of the letters on the keyboard and the \ufb01ngers used to type them (Gentner, 1988). The speed with\nwhich the piano is played is explicitly represented in the musical score, but the force with which the keys are struck is actively controlled bypianists as it determines sound intensity and contributes to the dynamics of the musical performance (C. Palmer, 1997). For skilled pianists, it\nis their ability to use variations in the force or intensity of notes played that differentiates their performance from that of amateurs (Krampe &\nEricsson, 1996; Shaffer, 1980).\nResearchers involved in the design of robotic hands built for dexterous applications have carefully scrutinized these results on the sensory and\nmotor capabilities of the human hand and used them to provide benchmarks for the design and evaluation of robotic hands (L. A. Jones, 1997;Venkataraman & Iberall, 1990). A major expectation of some early developers of dexterous robotic hands was that the robotic hand, with itsanthropomorphic geometry, would attain performance levels and capabilities comparable to those of the human hand (Melchiorri & Vassura,1993). This expectation neglected the formidable role played by the central nervous system in hand function. As the comparative anatomistFrederic Wood-Jones wrote in 1944: \u201cIt is not the hand that is perfect, but the whole nervous mechanism by which movements of the hand\nare evoked, co-ordinated and controlled \u201d(p. 300). In this context, it is of interest to note that whereas sensing the internalpositions (joint\nangles) and forces (joint torques) has been implemented in most dexterous robotic hands (e.g., Mason & Salisbury, 1985; McCammon &\nJacobsen, 1990), imparting a sense of touch to these devices remains a signi \ufb01cant challenge. A similar situation exists with the prosthetic hands\nused by people with upper-extremity amputations. A number of systems have been developed for providing tactile and proprioceptive\nfeedback to prosthetic hands (e.g., Kyberd et al., 1995; Scott, Brittain, Caldwell, Cameron, & Dun \ufb01eld, 1980), but these have met with limited\nclinical success due to problems with sensor technology, dif", "doc_id": "14e2186b-b2ce-4a2c-a51d-829853476868", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4c42f658da70a0405aacf2dd0b40b7a1b5a867682f16105083f19cc93199d2ba", "extra_info": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3671}, "relationships": {"1": "4727fb10-2636-48b6-af0b-621538a1caf9", "3": "835c5a10-2b12-490f-af38-c18c85f85a59"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "835c5a10-2b12-490f-af38-c18c85f85a59": {"__data__": {"text": "this context, it is of interest to note that whereas sensing the internalpositions (joint\nangles) and forces (joint torques) has been implemented in most dexterous robotic hands (e.g., Mason & Salisbury, 1985; McCammon &\nJacobsen, 1990), imparting a sense of touch to these devices remains a signi \ufb01cant challenge.

Molecular biological research is now focused on\ndiscovering the events that underlie the sense of touch (e.g., Goodman, Lumpkin, Ricci, Tracey, Kernan, & Nicolson, 2004). Goodman et al.have suggested that molecular identi \ufb01cation of candidate mechanotransduction channels in touch may ultimately reveal how transduction\nchannels are optimized to respond to tactile (and other forms of) mechanical energy and the extent to which accessory structures improve the\nresponse properties of mechanoreceptive cell types.\nAn understanding of the properties of sensory receptors in skin and muscles (chapter 3) is crucial to interpreting psychophysical data and has\nprovided a framework for dealing with some of the application issues discussed in chapter 10. In many instances, questions at one level of\nanalysis (e.g., what is the effect of mounting actuators in a haptic display on the dorsum of the \ufb01ngers rather than on the palmar surface?)\nrequire an answer that depends on knowledge acquired at another level (i.e., there will be a loss in sensitivity due to the reduced density ofmechanoreceptors on the dorsalsurface and associated higher threshol ds). In some areas of research, such as devel opmentalstudies of handfunction, there is still insuf \ufb01cient information to make these connections between different levels (i.e., neurophysiological, perceptual, or\nbehavioral) of analysis. For example, how much of the loss in manual sensory function in the elderly can be attributed to a decrease in\nperipheralmechanoreceptor popul ations and how much re \ufb02ects changes in cortical processing? At the other end of the life spectrum, it would\nbe of interest to know what maturationalchanges are occurring in chil dren between the ages of 6 and 12 years that can account for there\ufb01nement in their manual skills. It is clear from studies of \u201celite performers, \u201dbe they concert pianists, professionaljuggl ers, or expert typists,\nthat practice is essential to the acquisition and maintenance of manual skills.

First, Bolanowksi, Gescheider, and their colleagues have\nproposed two multichannel models of tactile sensation involving the contribution of either four (glabrous skin) or three (hairy skin)\npsychophysical vibrotactile channels, each one associated with its own physiological substrate (Bolanowski et al., 1988; Bolanowski et al., 1994,respectively). We suggested in chapter 4 that the models apply more speci \ufb01cally to vibrotactile sensation than broadly to the entire range of\ntactile sensations.

A second important avenue of future research pertains tospace-time interactions, which are surely important and necessary for a comprehensive understanding of tactile sensing by the hand. To date,this work has focused on spatiotemporal tactile illusions, such as apparent saltatory and continuous motion, and the tau and kappa illusions.\nHowever, we currently know little about the spatial and temporal parameters that affect susceptibility to these illusions when the hand is used.\nDesigners of tactile displays may wish to capitalize on manual illusory effects in space and/or time that can be produced by effectively and\ndiscretely stimulating relatively few sites on the skin. A third critical issue pertains to the ways in which the sensory systems organize multiple\nsensory inputs from the hand, ranging from simple sensations to more complex cognitive experiences of the external environment.

A fourth important research direction concerns the mechanisms by which one or more frames of reference affect the tactile\nperception of spatial patterns. This is a highly complex question that is currently far from well understood. A \ufb01fth research direction involves\nextending the early research on peripheral processing by the somatosensory system to include higher-level cognitive processes. This mightinclude somatosensory attention, a topic that has been addressed most recently in terms of possible visual-tactile interactions (e.g., Spence,Pavani, & Driver, 2000; but see Sinclair, Kuo, & Burton, 2000). Another topic that has received relatively little study to date is that of\nsomatosensory memory, surely a critical cognitive component of our manual experiences. The study of priming and the possible distinctionbetween implicit and explicit memory with respect to manual contact would provide valuable additions to the limited research in this area (e.g.,Srinivas, Greene, & Easton. 1997a, 1997b).\nAs our sixth and \ufb01nal research direction, we emphasize the fact that haptic perception of objects and their properties is usually performed in\nconjunction with other senses, particularly vision and/or audition. We concur with Goodwin and Wheat (2004), who suggest that a signi \ufb01cant\nchallenge for the future is to develop a global model of haptic exploration and manipulation that encompasses all of the senses. It is thereforecritical to consider both how and how well people integrate multiple sources of sensory information that are simultaneously available.Furthermore, we need to understand better how perceptualdiscrepancies are resol ved. Such issues have attracted a substantialamount ofattention since the mid-1990s within both the cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience research communities (Calvert et al., 2004; Ernst &Banks, 2002).\nResearch on the motor functions of the hand has primarily focused on grasping and keyboard skills, as reviewed in chapters 6 and 7. Although\nthe grasping studies described in chapter 6 have provided many valuable insights into the sensorimotor control of prehensile forces, the tasks\nused in most of these investigations are relatively simple from the perspective of the hands' capabilities. The most complex manipulative skillsof the human hand are often considered to be evident in tasks such as microsurgery, watch making, and microelectronic assembly, all of whichinvolve the use of tools and occupy a small work space (L. A. Jones, 1996; Starkes, Payk, Jennen, & Leclair, 1993). As with all motor skills,repetition is essentialto successfulexecution. In his book LetterstoaYoungDoctor , the surgeon-author Richard Selzer (1982) noted, \u201cA facility in\nknot tying is gained only by tying ten thousand of them \u201d(p. 49).\nOne area of future research that relates to the motor function of the hand is the analysis of highly skilled activities, such as microsurgery and\nmicro-assembly, which have not been as extensively studied as reaching and grasping movements. A comprehensive analysis of these skills\nwould provide a better understanding of human dexterity and the factors that in \ufb02uence its acquisition and retention. Many microsurgical\nprocedures involve a degree of dexterity that is at the limit of human capability .

The demanding precision requirements of microsurgery make it an\ninteresting \ufb01eld in which to explore the dimensions of manual skill and its relation to proprioceptive and visual perceptual abilities (Grober et\nal., 2003).\nA second area of future research that has received considerable attention but is still unresolved concerns the sensorimotor transformations\ninvolved when reaching or pointing with the arm to a target whose position is de \ufb01ned in a different coordinate system from that involved in\nencoding the position of208 Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions", "doc_id": "9e9d80cb-aad3-4ed1-b61f-776450f1fa02", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c8fdb2b119b3aa56c04053a104297c38f445602507527f9fcc6992db0de7a43a", "extra_info": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3163, "end": 5100}, "relationships": {"1": "42f234db-b3d2-49bc-90f9-05ccfa0e56a2", "2": "4511bd20-9fc8-435b-9aa8-eae88d249ba4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2df20d1-4a4d-4531-9aa3-7a765bb6dec9": {"__data__": {"text": "the limb as it moves. When the target is presented visually, the transformation involves going from a retinocentric representation to an\negocentric or body-centered representation, with the latter based on proprioceptive inputs. Flanders et al. (1992) proposed a two-stage process\nin which the retinocentric representation is transformed into a head-centered target representation and then into a shoulder-centered targetrepresentation. They derived this model from analyses of pointing errors that occurred when reaching under a fairly limited set of experimentalconditions. More general models of sensorimotor transformations must be able to accommodate the diverse range of variables that have been\nshown to in \ufb02uence pointing and reaching movements. These include the initial position and orientation of the arm, the visual feedback\nconditions during movement execution (i.e., in the light or dark, with or without vision of the target or the initial position of the arm), thedynamics and kinetics of the movement, and the \ufb01nalcon \ufb01guration of the hand and arm as it reaches the target.\nThird, we need a better understanding of the nature of the internalmodel s of tasks and objects that have emerged as an important theoretical\nconcept in motor control. In the context of grasping, these models are assumed to include both the dynamic and kinematic characteristics ofthe task and are assumed to be involved in the anticipatory control of grip forces. It has been proposed that, given the ease with which peoplecan grasp objects with widely varying properties, there must be many internal models within the central nervous system. There may also begeneric object models that are initially accessed based on visual and tactile information and then updated once contact is made with an object.The form and use of these models in human manual function warrant further investigation.\nFinally, we wish to note the recent proliferation of neural-imaging techniques, which now make it possible to explore the complexities of how\nthe brain processes and represents both sensory and motoric events. These range from simple internal tactile sensations (e.g., Francis, Kelly,\nBowtell, Dunseath, Folger, & McGlone, 2000; Romo & Salinas, 2003) to the haptic cognition of external objects and their properties (e.g.,\nJames, Humphrey, Gati, Servos, Menon, & Goodale, 2002; Roland, O'Sullivan, & Kawashima, 1998; Stoeckel, Weder, Binkofski, Buccino,Shah, & Seitz, 2003). Motor activities such as those involved in prehension and non-prehensile skilled tasks (e.g., Ehrsson, Fagergren,Johansson, & Forssberg, 2003; Ehrsson, Kuhtz-Buschbeck, & Forssberg, 2002; Kim et al., 2004) have also been the focus of recentneuroimaging studies. We anticipate signi \ufb01cant growth within this exciting \ufb01eld of neuroscience as imaging facilities become increasingly\naccessible to researchers.\nFinal Words\nIn conclusion, the sensorimotor continuum provides a valuable framework for conceptualizing the extensive range of activities in whichhumans engage as they explore, sense, perceive, and manipulate their environments by hand. From the simple task of knowing where an insect\nhas landed on the hand to the highly complex challenge of playing Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto, the performer makes use of the\nunique sensory and motor attributes of the hand. The quotation by Charles Bell cited in the introduction seems a \ufb01tting way to draw our\ndiscussions to a close: \u201c[W]e must confess that it is in the human hand that we have the consummation of all perfection as an instrument \u201d\n(Bell, 1833, p. 207).Summary, Conclusions, and Future Directions 209", "doc_id": "f2df20d1-4a4d-4531-9aa3-7a765bb6dec9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "47ae7f39dfcc95e33863b6303e7625d978d4e11e5e3895650b31c934d7293f1c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3627}, "relationships": {"1": "9bb9a60c-03d7-453a-b69e-ffecc5cbeaf3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0673faea-d0e9-4a94-b515-02dfa2cead79": {"__data__": {"text": "This page intentionally left blank ", "doc_id": "0673faea-d0e9-4a94-b515-02dfa2cead79", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b8d54da40f79a58e75b675e972b37b46439179438240d8777e3aec117d7357eb", "extra_info": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "1601839500-ebooksclub.org-human-hand-function.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 35}, "relationships": {"1": "d3c63bc2-2217-4ed4-af88-18548537ddaf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70069cee-f2d5-436d-a7cb-c423676fcd09": {"__data__": {"text": "REFERENCES\nAbravanel, E.

Fingertips to the Wrist for\nTwo-Finger Manipulation in Virtual Reality\nJasmin E. Palmer1, Mine Sarac2, Aaron A. Garza1, and Allison M. Okamura1\nAbstract \u2014 Relocation of haptic feedback from the \ufb01ngertips\nto the wrist has been considered as a way to enable hap-\ntic interaction with mixed reality virtual environments while\nleaving the \ufb01ngers free for other tasks. We present a pair of\nwrist-worn tactile haptic devices and a virtual environment to\nstudy how various mappings between \ufb01ngers and tactors affect\ntask performance. The haptic feedback rendered to the wrist\nre\ufb02ects the interaction forces occurring between a virtual object\nand virtual avatars controlled by the index \ufb01nger and thumb.\nWe performed a user study comparing four different \ufb01nger-to-\ntactor haptic feedback mappings and one no-feedback condition\nas a control. We evaluated users\u2019 ability to perform a simple\npick-and-place task via the metrics of task completion time,\npath length of the \ufb01ngers and virtual cube, and magnitudes\nof normal and shear forces at the \ufb01ngertips. We found that\nmultiple mappings were effective, and there was a greater\nimpact when visual cues were limited. We discuss the limitations\nof our approach and describe next steps toward multi-degree-\nof-freedom haptic rendering for wrist-worn devices to improve\ntask performance in virtual environments.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nMany tactile haptic feedback devices that render forces\nfrom interactions with virtual objects provide forces directly\nto the glabrous skin of the \ufb01ngertips, taking advantage of\ntheir mechanoreceptor density [1], [2], [3]. Because these\ndevices are deliberately designed to cover the \ufb01ngers and\n\ufb01ngertips, they prevent users from simultaneously inter-\nacting with physical tools, which is detrimental for many\nmixed reality scenarios such as surgical training, guidance\nfor assembly and repair, and remote collaboration. Leaving\nthe \ufb01ngers free of encumbrance can also facilitate optical\npredictive tracking to enhance the responsiveness of haptic\nfeedback [4].\nHaptic feedback can be relocated from the \ufb01ngertips to\nother locations on the body, which would enable haptic\ninteraction with mixed reality virtual environments while\nleaving the \ufb01ngers free for other tasks or to simultaneously\nmanipulate physical tools. We propose to provide feedback\nat the wrist or the forearm near the wrist. Such relocation\nhas been previously shown to improve task performance,\nuser acceptance, and task enjoyment compared to scenarios\nwith no haptic feedback [5], [6], [7], [8].

That is, the less accurate perception on the arm\ncompared to the \ufb01ngertips might make haptic illusions more\nfeasible [10].\nWe aim to understand the best practices of haptic relo-\ncation to the wrist during virtual manipulation tasks. We\npreviously investigated the effects of feedback location on the\nwrist (dorsal vs. ventral vs. both sides) [11] and the rendered\nfeedback direction (normal vs. shear) [12], [13]. Our results\nshowed that participants\u2019 perception was not affected by\neither feedback location or direction, as long as the par-\nticipants observed noticeable, meaningful haptic feedback.\nIn these studies, participants were asked to discriminate the\nstiffness property of virtual objects by pushing the objects\ntoward the ground using the index \ufb01nger. Thus, we only\ncalculated the interaction forces acting on a single \ufb01ngertip\nand rendered haptic feedback on the wrist. However, generic\nmanipulation tasks should be performed by at least two\n\ufb01ngers, e.g. the index \ufb01nger and thumb, creating opposing\nforces acting on the objects. Even though one might assume\nthat the interaction forces on both \ufb01ngertips should be equal\nat all times, this would not correspond to scenarios in which\nthe user translates or rotates a held object in the virtual\nenvironment due to inertial and gravitational effects.\nIn this paper, we created and tested various \ufb01nger-to-\ntactor mappings that de\ufb01ne the relationship between virtual\nenvironment interaction forces at the \ufb01ngertips and rendered\nhaptic feedback at particular wrist locations. The tactor is\nthe part of the haptic device that presses into the skin, in our\ncase near the wrist. We hypothesize that participants will\nperform a simple virtual manipulation task better when (1)\n\ufb01ngertip forces are rendered on the wrist individually (rather\nthan in combination or using a single \ufb01ngertip force), and\n(2) index \ufb01nger and thumb forces are mapped to the dorsal\nand ventral sides on the wrist, respectively (rather than to\nthe ventral and dorsal sides, respectively). To test this, we\ncalculated the virtual environment forces acting on the user\u2019s\nindex \ufb01nger and thumb and used those forces to generate\nhaptic feedback via a pair of wrist-worn tactile haptic devices\nmounted on the same wrist. We conducted a user study to\ninvestigate the impact of \ufb01nger-to-tactor mapping on user\nperformance during a simple virtual manipulation task. The\nmain contribution of this work is an understanding of how the\nmappings of \ufb01ngertip haptic interactions to locations on the\nwrist affect manipulation of virtual objects, to guide future\ndesign and rendering for wrist-worn haptic devices.arXiv:2209.07640v2  [cs.HC]  14 Nov 2022", "doc_id": "5ea46112-c3dc-4f42-89a2-2baff880c890", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7cebefaa0eb33a316dd528cb5b9d60da25e000ed7cab604bc7237eb6d0d2d4ff", "extra_info": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "2209.07640.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 2897, "end": 6067}, "relationships": {"1": "39b407ce-c37f-44b2-ac5d-923c4674e67a", "2": "3ac4da8b-2bba-41a9-b299-c31ef0c4a564"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c30fb20f-0be8-463f-ab0a-b29afcec9c24": {"__data__": {"text": "Fig. 1.

Device Design\nA pair of one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) wrist-worn tac-\ntile haptic devices provide skin deformation normal to the\nuser\u2019s wrist via a tactor to display simulated interaction\nforces. Each tactor is actuated via a lightweight 6.2 g\nHXT500 micro servo motor by Hextronik. The servo motor\nis attached to a rack and pinion mechanism which was 3D\nprinted. The rack has a maximum usable extension of 15\nmm and the pinion has a pitch radius of 5.75 mm. The servo\nmotor is open-loop position controlled via digital I/O using\na Sensoray 826 PCI Express board at constant speed with a\nPWM frequency of 50 Hz.\nThe user wears two of these devices simultaneously on\nthe same wrist, one on the ventral side, and the other one on\nthe dorsal side of the wrist as shown in Fig. 1. The poses\nof the user\u2019s index \ufb01nger and thumb are tracked using an\nelectromagnetic 6-DoF tracker by Ascension trakSTAR with\ntwo Model 800 sensors and a pair of 3D-printed mounts on\nthe dorsal (\ufb01ngernail) side of each \ufb01nger, leaving the ventral\n(palm-facing) side of the \ufb01ngertips free during manipulation\ntasks. The tracked \ufb01nger pose is displayed in the virtual\nenvironment (as will be discussed in Section II-B) so the\nuser can interact with a dynamic virtual object. Each device\nprovides haptic feedback corresponding to virtual interaction\nforces occurring on either the index \ufb01nger and/or the thumb\n(as will be described in Section II-C).\nB. Virtual Environment\nTo connect our physical devices to our virtual world,\nwe apply a Hooke\u2019s Law model ( jFj=kjxj) to convert\nthe interaction force ( F=Fx+Fy+Fz) in the virtual\nenvironment to a desired position of the tactor, which pushes\nonto the skin.

This seemed logical because of\ngeometric congruence, which might make it easy for users to\ninterpret wrist haptic feedback corresponding to \ufb01nger haptic\nfeedback. For Mapping 2, we switched the wrist locations\ncompared to Mapping 1. This was motivated by biomechani-\ncal considerations and expanding on our previous work [13].\nIndex \ufb01nger movement corresponds to musculature on the\nventral side of the forearm such as the \ufb02exor digitorum\nprofundus and thumb movement corresponds to musculature\non the dorsal side of theforearm such as the abductor pollicis\nlongus. It stands to reason that pressing on or near these\nstructures could also generate a mapping that is natural for\nusers to understand. Additionally, there may be an effect of\nmuscle activity on the wrist, where tactors have been placed\nin previous studies [13].\nMappings 3 and are 4 are motivated by the idea that it may\nbe possible to reduce actuation complexity by using only\na single tactor. For Mapping 3, only the interaction forces\nacting on the index \ufb01nger are considered, and it is mapped\nto the dorsal side of the wrist. For Mapping 4, we averaged\nthe forces of the two \ufb01ngers and mapped that average tothe dorsal side of the wrist. For both Mappings 3 and 4,\nwe could have mapped to the ventral side of the wrist, but\nprior work [12] indicated that either side would be effective.\nFinally, \u201cControl\u201d had no programmed haptic feedback,\nwhich was important as a baseline to measure the effect of\nthe other mappings. For all mappings, the mounting of the\ndevice on the user\u2019s wrist remained consistent regardless of\nthe actuator activity.\nIII. E XPERIMENTAL METHODS\nA.

C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn summary, we found that the order in which users were\npresented with each of the 5 \ufb01nger-to-tactor mappings does\nnot result in a noticeable difference in the task performance\nmetrics. However, when changing the visibility of the cube,\nthe task performance metrics had noticeable trends. Partic-\nipants also qualitatively rated Mapping 1, the geometrical\ncongruent mapping, as the best for ease of task performance\nalthough this preference was not statistically signi\ufb01cant.\nCompletion time for each trial and path lengths of the\nindex \ufb01nger, thumb, and cube were lower for the visible\ncube group compared to the invisible cube group during the\nexperiment, showing more ef\ufb01cient completion of the task\nfor the former group. However, no statistically signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences in performance occurred regardless of mapping.\nWe observed no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in index\nnormal, index shear, and thumb shear force regardless of\nmapping for all subjects. However, we did observe sta-\ntistical signi\ufb01cance between mappings for thumb normal\nforce. Additionally, we observed a signi\ufb01cant difference\nbetween the visible cube group and invisible cube group\nwhen analyzing the effect of visibility for the index normal,\nindex shear, and thumb shear force. However, there was no\nstatistically signi\ufb01cant difference for the thumb normal force.\nAll performance metrics were evaluated during the testing\nphase of the experiment.\nIn future work, we plan to develop and test a multi-\nDoF device and determine whether adding more DoFs to\nthe haptic feedback will be as effective on the wrist as it\nis on the \ufb01ngertips, as well as which combination of DoFs\nare optimal. We believe that there will be an improvement\nover 1-DoF haptic feedback on the wrist, and will quantify\nthe differences in performance metrics and behavior in the\nvirtual environment. We also intend to extend this work to\na more immersive mixed reality environment and continue\nto use the multi-DoF device and mappings we determine are\noptimal. A new mixed reality environment will be developed\nusing the Unity game engine and CHAI3D haptics and\nsimulation framework. We will integrate this new frameworkwith a Microsoft HoloLens 2 Augmented Reality headset. In\na future user study, we will investigate how the augmented\nhaptic feedback aids in training and perception for virtual\nobjects integrated in a real-world environment.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. B.

All rights reserved. 2013Writing and Publishing  \na Research Paper 8CHAPTER \nIn Chapter 4 I noted that publication is the final step in research (see section 4.1.1). \nIt is fitting, then, to make our final step a chapter on writing and publishing a \nresearch paper.\nMost HCI research papers present a novel interface idea, then describe an evalu -\nation of the idea in a user study. User studies are designed (or should be designed!) \naccording to accepted standards for experiments with human participants, as laid \nout in Chapter 5. Adhering to accepted standards is important in HCI and other \nfields since the practice brings consistency to the body of work that contributes to \nand defines the field. This practice extends to the final step in research\u2014preparing \nand publishing the results.\n8.1 Conference papers, journal papers\nThe main venues for publishing HCI research papers are conference proceedings \nor journals. Journals are considered the top tier for research publications. There \nare two primary reasons. First, journal submissions undergo a tightly controlled \npeer review to ensure the research is novel, correct, and carried out according to \naccepted standards in the field. The reviewers are experts in the subject matter and \nare enlisted by the journal\u2019s editor or by a member of the editorial board. Second, \njournals are archived in major libraries around the world; thus, research published \nin a journal is readily available to other researchers. For some disciplines such as \nphysics, journal publications are virtually all that matter, with conference contribu -\ntions viewed as little more than a summary of one\u2019s presentation at a meeting, the \ncontent of which appears (or will appear) in a journal publication. So the review of \nsubmissions to physics conferences is cursory, at best.\nHCI is different. HCI conferences bring together researchers and practitioners, \nas noted in Chapter 1. The practitioners are the engineers and designers of products, \nand they are there to learn about the latest research in HCI. Life cycles and time -\nlines for such products are short. The big players, like Apple, Microsoft, and Nokia, \nannounce new products regularly and with great fanfare. So reaching and influenc -\ning the designers and engineers of products requires HCI research to have a short ", "doc_id": "2ac85982-13cd-4dff-8ecd-4ca7dc9a1687", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fb789e1ceb897bee89f130cb2cf58e2a7635f2206138c59c408f66b8a6922dcf", "extra_info": {"page_label": "293", "file_name": "3-s2.0-B978012405865100008X-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2380}, "relationships": {"1": "1df76434-eaa2-4561-89a6-e9005151305a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "298bf53e-4839-491b-bb3c-fbcf7d28e7d7": {"__data__": {"text": "294 CHAPTER 8  Writing and Publishing a Research Paper \ntimeline.1 Unfortunately, the timeline from submission to publication in a journal is \nlong\u2014typically one to two years, sometimes more. For conferences the timeline is \nshort\u2014typically eight months, sometimes less. It is no surprise, then, that confer -\nences and conference publications have emerged as an important vehicle for pre -\nsenting and publishing research in HCI. Simply put, publishing in a conference \nproceedings is the quickest way to get one\u2019s work \u201cout there.\u201d Furthermore, the \narchival advantage for journals no longer exists. Today, the term archive  extends to \nonline databases maintained by organizations such as the ACM or IEEE. The review \nprocess is also different. For some HCI conferences, the peer review process is as \nrigorous as it is with many journals. So the prestige of publishing in some HCI con -\nferences, such as the ACM\u2019s annual SIGCHI conference, equals that of publishing in \nsome journals.\nPrior to publication, a research paper is a manuscript . In most cases, the venue \nfor submitting is decided before writing begins. The decision will depend on many \nfactors such as the subject matter, the timing and scope of the research, and the \nprestige of the conference or journal. Additional factors for considering a con -\nference are location and travel costs, since acceptance of the manuscript implies \nattending the conference to present the research in a talk.\nJournals generally have relaxed requirements for the format of submissions. \nThis is reasonable since a journal submission, if accepted, undergoes a round or \ntwo of revision before publication. Revisions are introduced to improve the manu -\nscript based on the referees\u2019 suggestions. Acceptance is often conditional on final \napproval by the journal editor or referees. Publication in a journal also includes pro -\nfessional copyediting by the journal staff. Hence, the formatting of the initial manu -\nscript is not so important.\nConferences, on the other hand, have strict requirements on the format of sub -\nmissions, including page length. There are a few reasons. For one, the timeline is \nshort. The entire process is deadline-driven, with dates that are set for the initial \nsubmission, reviewer feedback, notification (accept or reject), and final submission. \nThe initial submission must be formatted as per the conference requirements (see \nbelow), since there is very little time to rework a rough manuscript into the final \ncamera-ready copy that is published.\nAnother reason for formatting the initial submission is that the responsibil -\nity lies with the author(s) to provide the final camera-ready copy that is published. \nAcceptance usually includes a request for \u201cminor revisions,\u201d again, based on refer -\nees\u2019 suggestions. However, there is little or no vetting of the revisions or of the for -\nmatting within the manuscript, in part due to the short timelines. So formatting lies \nwith the author and precedes the initial submission.\nBefore delving into formatting and presentation, let\u2019s examine the major parts \nof a research paper.

The backdrop paper describes a novel interface idea, which was evalu -\nated in a user study. The user study is elaborated in the \u201cMethod\u201d and \u201cResults and \nDiscussion\u201d sections. Some HCI research papers do not describe a user study. The \nannual ACM SIGCHI conference, for example, welcomes other types of submissions, \nsuch as \u201cTheory,\u201d \u201cArgument,\u201d or \u201cSystems, Tools, Architectures and Infrastructure.\u201d2 \nAlthough in the minority, such contributions are important to HCI. And it is likely \nthey do not include a user study (although they could). It is worth reiterating the \nimportant role of non-experimental research in HCI. However, our discussion here \nfocuses on a traditional HCI research paper with a user study. Let\u2019s proceed.\n2 These contribution types were noted in the CHI 2012  submissions web site ( http://chi2012.acm.org/\ncfp-contribution-types.shtml ).\nFIGURE 8.1\nParts of a research paper.

A title is short, so every word must contribute. The title must \nidentify the subject area of the paper while at the same time narrowing the scope \nof the work. The backdrop paper in Figure 8.1  is titled \u201cEyes-free Text Entry With \nError Correction on Touchscreen Mobile Devices.\u201d \u201cEyes-free Text Entry\u201d identi -\nfies the subject area, but alone, this is too broad. Adding \u201cWith Error Correction\u201d \nlimits the scope of the work. Adding \u201con Touchscreen Mobiles Devices\u201d fur -\nther limits the scope. Some discretion is at work here. An overly broad title fails \nto indicate if the paper is relevant to a sub-topic within a subject area (e.g., error \ncorrection techniques as applied to text entry). Furthermore, an overly broad title \nis misleading. Using only \u201cEyes-free Text Entry\u201d as the title implies that the work \naddresses a wider area of research than it actually does.\nTitles are often in two parts with a separator (typically a colon) between the \nmain title and a secondary title. There are no rules here. Either part can serve to \nbroaden or narrow the scope of the work. Often the goal is to catch the attention \nof the reader, perhaps with a provocative claim or phrase; for example, \u201cSilk From \na Cow\u2019s Ear: Extracting Usable Structures From the Web\u201d (Pirolli, Pitkow, and \nRao, 1996). Another trick is to conjure up a name for a novel technique or method \nand then position the name in the title; for example, \u201cTwitinfo: Aggregating and \nVisualizing Microblogs for Event Exploration \u201d (Marcus et al., 2011). Combining \nTwit (for Twitter ) and info (for information) into Twitinfo has the added benefit \nof creating a new keyword for future searches. If the aforementioned Twitinfo is \nadopted in subsequent research, the source is easily retrieved via a search engine \nusing Twitinfo as a search keyword. In short, any title is fine provided it is concise, \nidentifies the subject area, and narrows the scope of the work.\nThe title is followed by the names of, affiliations with, and contact information \nfor the authors. This information is provided and positioned according to the sub -\nmission requirements of the conference or journal.\n8.2.2  Abstract\nThe abstract is written last. There is typically a size limit imposed, such as 150 \nwords, so the abstract must be concise. No room to expound! The abstract is a sin -\ngle paragraph and should not include any citations. After the title, the abstract is \nlikely the first part of the research paper that is read. The title has caught some -\none\u2019s interest; the abstract then delivers a succinct summary of the story within. \nAfter reading the abstract, the reader will decide if the rest of the paper is relevant \nand worth reading.\nIf the abstract is poorly written and fails to deliver on its essential objective (see \nnext paragraph), then the paper has little chance of being read, or even worse, being \naccepted for publication. So edit, edit, edit. The abstract should be the best-written \nsection of the paper. The English and grammar should be perfect, the content suc -\ncinct and clear.

The abstract should tell the reader what \nwas done  and what was found . Both themes are highly condensed since the abstract \nis constrained in size. Nevertheless, this is the abstract\u2019s mission. An example of \na well-crafted abstract is provided by Sandnes (2006, 245) in a paper titled \u201cCan \nSpatial Mnemonics Accelerate the Learning of Text Input Chords?\u201d:\nThis study addresses to what extent spatial mnemonics can be used to assist users \nto memorise or infer a set of text input chords. Users mentally visualise the appear -\nance of each character as a 3x3 pixel grid. This grid is input as a sequence of three \nchords using one, two or three fingers to construct each chord. Experiments show \nthat users are able to use the strategy after a few minutes of instruction, and that \nsome subjects enter text without help after three hours of practice. Further, the \nexperiments show that text can be input at a mean rate of 5.9 words per minute (9.9 \nwords per minute for the fastest subject) after 3 hours of practice. On the downside, \nthe approach suffers from a relatively high error rate of about 10% as subjects often \nresort to trial and error when recalling character patterns.\nThe first three sentences convey the topic of the research and what was done. \nThe last three sentences convey what was found. The abstract is short (144 words). \nIt fulfills its mandate, no more, no less. Note that there is no introductory mate -\nrial. Indeed, an abstract is not the place to introduce the subject matter of the paper. \nUnfortunately, treating the abstract as an introduction is a common flaw. This point \ndeserves emphasis: The abstract is not an introduction to the subject matter of the \npaper . The reader has read the title and is now examining the abstract for further \ndetails. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the reader is familiar with the sub -\nject matter. Save the introductory material for the Introduction. Another common \nflaw in abstracts is the failure to give specific results. All too often, abstracts convey \ngeneral conclusions and note that detailed results and discussions are found in the \npaper. Not good. Convey the most salient finding(s) in the abstract.\n8.2.3  Keywords\nKeywords are used for database indexing and searching. They allow others who are \ninterested in the work to find it. Keywords are chosen by the author. They identify \nthe subject matter and the scope of the work. For the backdrop paper in Figure 8.1 , \nthe keywords are \u201cEyes-free, text entry, touchscreen, finger input, gestural input, \nGraffiti, auditory display, error correction, mobile computing.\u201d\nSince 1998, research papers published in ACM conference proceedings or jour -\nnals are required to also include indexing and retrieval information according to the \nACM\u2019s Computing Classification System (CCS). As the ACM notes, \u201cThis is bene -\nficial to you because accurate categorization provides the reader with quick content \nreference, facilitating the search for related literature, as well as searches for your \nwork in ACM\u2019s Digital Library and other online resources.\u201d3 In applying the CCS, \n3 www.acm.org/about/class/how-to-use .", "doc_id": "f72bb695-6695-4c3a-bbde-4dae3edea248", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "04ca7d3f381227deb0e6a7216cb64c6bee5c981fe54fcc1e136575be96767fbb", "extra_info": {"page_label": "297", "file_name": "3-s2.0-B978012405865100008X-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3235}, "relationships": {"1": "57eb6063-ccc0-4b71-a427-cda941f8d8ca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9144d13e-73ed-40fe-be5f-06059fcecb35": {"__data__": {"text": "298 CHAPTER 8  Writing and Publishing a Research Paper \nresearch papers include \u201cCategories and Subject Descriptors\u201d and \u201cGeneral Terms.\u201d \n(For conference submissions, the general terms are optional.) The descriptors and \nterms are provided by the ACM, not the author. Since the CCS spans all of com -\nputer science, the choices are numerous. The descriptors and terms for the backdrop \npaper in Figure 8.1  are shown in Figure 8.2 . The terms are taken from the ACM\u2019s \nCCS, which is available online (see URL in footnote). The formatting shown in \nthe figure (e.g., brackets, bold, italics) is required and must be strictly followed. \nAlthough choosing descriptors and terms is a challenge, there is an easy way. Just \nfind a paper on the same or similar topic in the same proceedings or journal as the \npaper in preparation and mimic that paper\u2019s descriptors and terms. In fact, the ACM \nrecommends this (see URL in footnote). Of course, care is warranted in the event of \nan inappropriate descriptor in a published paper.\n8.2.4  Introduction\nThe opening section of a research paper is typically called Introduction , although \nother labels, such as Background , are fine as well. The introduction gives the con -\ntext for the research. Usually opening comments characterize the state of the art and \nindicate why the subject matter is interesting and relevant. A user interface problem \nor challenge is identified and the reader is alerted, early on, to the solution that is \ndeveloped in the rest of the paper. It is common practice to give an overview of the \ncontents of the entire paper, usually at a convenient place within the first page or so \nof the introduction. Figure 8.3  is an example from the backdrop paper ( Figure 8.1 ). \nThe excerpt appears as the fifth paragraph in the introduction.\nIt is also desirable to state the contribution of the work. This is tricky, since it \nentails laying down the bragging rights, so to speak, for a novel aspect of the work. \nA statement like, \u201cThe approach presented here is the first example of . . .\u201d is strong \nbut in most cases should be avoided. Usually it is sufficient to note that the idea \nimproves on existing practice, or something similar.\nThe introduction may span several sections. Any reasonable organization is fine. \nOther sections may use the same level of heading as the introductory section, and \nsubsections may be added as appropriate. It\u2019s your story to tell! Take liberties to \nprepare and organize the introduction as you see fit.\nUsually a literature review is expected. This is typically organized in a separate \nsection, with an appropriate heading (e.g., Related Work ).

The introduction usually \nfinishes with a statement indicating the need to test the idea in an empirical evalua -\ntion. This sets the stage for the method section.\n8.2.5  Method\nThe method section of a research paper tells the reader how the experiment was \ndesigned and carried out. Although the heading Method  or Methodology  is \nmost common, this section is sometimes given other titles, such as Evaluation , \nExperiment , User Study , etc.\nThe method section should be written in an entirely straightforward fashion. \nAny creative flair conveyed in the introduction should come to a full stop here. The \nmethod section should read like a recipe. The reader wants to know what you did \nand how you did it. This information must be delivered in a style that is simple, \nclear, and predictable.\nI noted earlier that a critical requirement of research is that it must be reproduci -\nble (see section 4.1.3). The method section delivers this crucial property. After read -\ning the method section a reader might ask, \u201cCould this research be reproduced?\u201d \nIf the reader is reviewing the manuscript for a conference or journal and answer is \n\u201cno\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d there is little chance of acceptance.\nPredictability is important. It allows a reader to scour papers and quickly find \nkey points and results. A reader will lose patience if it is a struggle to determine \nthe independent and dependent variables, the number of participants, the tasks per -\nformed by participants, and other important details of the experiment. So keep it \nsimple, make it predictable. On predictability, convention dictates that the method \nsection is divided into the following subsections (and in the following order):\nl Participants\nl Apparatus\nl Procedure\nl Design\nLet\u2019s examine each of these.In the f ollowing section, we br iefly descr ibe our or iginal \nprototype .

Relevant demographic information is also given, such as age, gender, \nand related experience. Other details might be useful, such as level of education, \nfirst language, handedness, or whether the participants wore eye glasses or cor -\nrective lenses. The details to provide depend on the task and apparatus used in the \nexperiment.\nThe information on participants identifies the population  of people used and, \ntherefore, the population to which the results apply. It is reasonable to limit the \npopulation pool to people with certain skills or attributes, if it makes sense for the \nresearch. An experiment on gaming devices, for example, might only enlist college-\nage users who play computer games more than 10 hours per week. That\u2019s fine, but \nthe results may not generalize to other people.\nThe participants section is usually short\u2014just a couple of sentences. However, \nif a property of the user (cf. the interface) is an independent variable, then the par -\nticipants section is often more detailed. For example, Brajnik et al. (2011) describe \nan experiment where an independent variable was \u201cexpertise in judging websites \nfor accessibility.\u201d The experiment included a group of experts and a group of non-\nexperts. The participants section of the paper is quite detailed, as it is necessary \nto quantify the degree of expertise for both groups and to describe how such was \ndetermined and applied.\n8.2.5.2 Apparatus\nThe Apparatus  section describes the hardware and software. Other titles for this \nsection include Materials , Interface , etc. Think of reproducibility when preparing \nthis section. Give all the details necessary so that a skilled researcher could repli -\ncate the apparatus if he or she chooses. Of course, needless details can be excluded. \nMention, perhaps, that the test computer was a Lenovo Thinkpad T60 running \nMicrosoft Windows 7, but the amount of memory or the capacity of the hard drive \nis likely of no consequence. Some discretion is warranted. If the experimental task \ninvolved finger input on a touchscreen, then the make and model of the touchscreen \nshould be given. Other details that might be relevant include the screen resolution, \nscreen size, sampling rate, how the screen was held, or even the participants\u2019 finger \nsizes.\nIf the experiment used a custom interface, the development language (e.g., Java) \nand other relevant details should be given. It is particularly useful to provide screen \nsnaps or photos of the interface. If comprehensive details of the interface were dis -\nclosed prior to the method section, then it is reasonable to simply refer the reader to \nthe earlier material; for example, \u201cthe software included the algorithm described in \nthe preceding section.\u201d\n8.2.5.3 Procedure\nThe procedure section tells exactly what happened with each participant.

It is also common to indicate if participants were paid, \nvolunteered without pay, or were required to participate, for example, as part of a \nuniversity course.\nTypically, participants are tested over multiple conditions and perhaps multiple \ntrials for each condition. Give the details. Usually there is a specific task that par -\nticipants performed. Ensure the task is properly defined. What was the task? What \nwas the goal of the task? When did timing begin and end? Were errors recorded? \nGive a precise definition of what constituted an error. Were participants allowed and \ninstructed to correct errors? Did they correct all errors or only at their discretion? \nHow were errors corrected? Were rest breaks allowed or encouraged? What was the \ntotal time for testing with each participant? And so on. Again, a screen snap of the \ninterface may help. It is also useful to include a photograph of a participant per -\nforming the task.\n8.2.5.4 Design\nThe design section summarizes the experiment in terms of the independent vari -\nables (factors and levels), the dependent variables (measures and units), or other \nrelevant details. For short papers, these details are sometimes given in the proce -\ndure section. It is common to begin with a statement such as, \u201cThe experiment was \na 3 \u00d7 2 within-subjects design.\u201d If counterbalancing was used, the way the condi -\ntions were administered to participants should be stated. Be thorough and clear! It\u2019s \nimportant that your research is reproducible.\nA good way to conclude the design section is to indicate the total number of \ntrials administered in the experiment. This can be revealed by a calculation that \nincludes the number of participants and the variables and repetitions in the study. \nFigure 8.4  shows how this was done in the backdrop paper ( Figure 8.1 ), which \nused a text entry task with feedback mode (three levels) as the main independent \nvariable.\n8.2.6  Results and discussion\nFollowing the method section, the results of the experiment are given.

Before pre -\nsenting the results it is common to describe the statistical approach and tests used in \nthe data analysis.\nAlthough there are no strict rules, it is common to use subsections that organize \nthe results by dependent measures, beginning with the most important dependent \nvariable. Often this is speed or task completion time. Then results are presented for \naccuracy or error rate, followed by results for other dependent variables.\nFor each dependent variable, begin with a broad observation, such as the overall \nmean, and then move to finer details such as the means for each test condition. The \ndifference in the means between test conditions is the effect size. In HCI, effect \nsize is typically given either as an absolute difference or as a relative difference, \nexpressing the percent difference between one condition and another. Providing the \nmeans as absolute values and the difference as a percent is useful since the practical \nimplications of results can be assessed. For example, if the mean task completion \ntime was 3.0 seconds for Method A and 2.7 seconds for Method B, then the result \ncan be presented as in Figure 8.5 .\nIt is important to explain the results through discussion: What caused the dif -\nferences in the measurements across experimental conditions? What detail in the \ninteraction caused one method to be slower? Did one condition require more input \nactions? Were participants confused? Was the method hard to learn? Did partici -\npants experience fatigue or discomfort? Were corrective actions required as the task \nwas carried out? Obviously the answers lie in the interactions used in the experi -\nment and the observations made by the experimenter or obtained through a post-\nexperiment questionnaire or interview.\nThere is very likely a difference in the observed dependent measures across \nexperimental conditions. The difference may be real or it may be an artifact of the \nvariability that occurs in experiments with human participants. Of course, finding a \nreal difference is often the goal of the research: a novel interaction method improves \non an existing interaction method. \u201cImproves on\u201d usually implies interaction that \nis faster, more accurate, more efficient, or better in some other quantifiable manner \n(e.g., fewer re-tries, less movement, higher quality results, etc.). Testing for a real \ndifference typically involves doing an analysis of variance on the data, as described \nin Chapter 6. The results of this test are given in a succinct statement indicating the \noutcome. See Figure 6.5 for an example where the difference is real (i.e., statisti -\ncally significant).

In conveying the ANOV A results, \nbear in mind that the statistical tests are not the results per se. The results lie in the \nobservations and measurements.

But the statistical test is simply the supporting \nevidence. The result is the difference in outcome between the test conditions.\nExperimental software is often designed to log a considerable amount of data. \nSifting through the data is a daunting task; however, do not feel compelled to \nshare all the data with the reader. Giving too many results or too much data is an \nindication that you can\u2019t distinguish what is important from what is unimportant.  \nA key challenge, then, is deciding on which results to present and which not to pre -\nsent. Furthermore, there is generally no value added in giving results just \u201cfor the \nrecord.\u201d If there is no insight to be gleaned from a result, then don\u2019t include it.\nAnother way to make results interesting for the reader is through visuals. Bar \ncharts, line graphs, 3D plots, or the like appear in most research papers in HCI, \nwith examples appearing throughout this book.\nThe results and discussion section should compare the results with those in \nother research papers on a similar topic, citing prior work as appropriate. Is the new \ntechnique faster, slower, more accurate, less accurate?\nThe results and discussion section also summarizes information obtained \nthrough questionnaires or interviews given at the end of testing. Participant feed -\nback is often enlightening. Include it. Discuss it. What does participant feedback \nsuggest in terms of improvements to the interaction?\n8.2.7  Conclusion\nThe conclusion summarizes what you did, restates the important findings, and \nrestates the contribution. It is common to identify topics for future work, although \ndeveloping new ideas is to be avoided in the concluding section.\nThe conclusion is often followed by an acknowledgment thanking funding \nsources as well as people who assisted in some way with the research.\n8.2.8  References\nThe last section of a research paper is the reference list. The list contains the full bib -\nliographic details on papers cited earlier in the paper. Only papers cited in the paper \nare included in the reference list. References should be formatted as stipulated by the \nconference or journal. Formatting details are discussed in the next section.\n8.3 Preparing the manuscript\nThe experience in reading a research paper should be like the experience in lis -\ntening to music.

But there is more. Research that is crea -\ntive and well executed might fail to engage the reader due to factors aside from the \nquality of the research. If the reader is distracted due to flaws in the delivery and pres -\nentation, he or she may have difficulty following and understanding the ideas. Soon \nenough, the reader\u2019s patience wears thin. So presenting ideas that are creative and \nwell executed is not enough. The story must be properly assembled and presented.\nIn this section, I present ideas and suggestions on preparing a manuscript. The \nprocess is more about transparency than flair: writing in a straightforward style and \nconstructing figures, tables, and other visuals that are simple, clear, and consist -\nent. Easier said than done. But resist any temptation to jazz up the presentation.  \nA research paper is a product of scholarship, not a marketing brochure.\n8.3.1  Formatting\nFormatting is about the minutia: the punctuation, spelling, capitalization, italics, \nquotations, abbreviations, numbers, variables, and so on. These properties of a man -\nuscript are important for clarity and flow. The goal is to get the formatting right; actu -\nally, perfect. In fact, get it so perfect that the reader won\u2019t even notice. Remember, \none of the first persons to read the paper will be a reviewer, who will make a recom -\nmendation for accepting or rejecting the paper. Will the reviewer critique the paper \nbased on its value and novelty and put aside a confusing presentation or poor format -\nting that causes him or her to read, then re-read? Perhaps, but this is a chance you \ndon\u2019t want to take. It is distinctly possible that a reviewer who struggles with format -\nting flaws and other distractions will eventually lose patience and render a negative \nopinion. The goal is to let the story of the research come through.\nFormatting rules are too numerous to set out here. Fortunately, there are numer -\nous references to assist. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological \nAssociation  (APA) is recommended (APA, 2010). Chapter 4 in the latest edition \n(the 6th) is The Mechanics of Style. It contains a wealth of tips, actually rules , for \nformatting manuscripts. There are subsections on small details\u2014proper use of the \nperiod, comma, semicolon, colon, double or single quotation marks, parentheses, \nbrackets, slash\u2014and subsections on broader details like capitalization, hyphena -\ntion, italics, abbreviations, statistics, and spelling. The APA also has a style website \n(www.apastyle.org ) that is searchable on any topic of interest, including formatting \nrules.\nOf course, a dictionary is also a valuable asset. Reputable dictionaries such as \nMerriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary  or the Oxford English Dictionary  are \nconsidered the final authority on spelling.4 For some words there are differences in ", "doc_id": "a72ba31c-bc72-41d2-b7b1-719c3d40b1d1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "847c4ea7099015f19370314b93c47eed9d4f13d8b1f93b3fa2d33130ba2167f4", "extra_info": {"page_label": "304", "file_name": "3-s2.0-B978012405865100008X-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3408}, "relationships": {"1": "41592231-3565-406a-94f7-0f3ece149516"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e04f8774-0fa0-43ca-afc7-8bcf4dc0166d": {"__data__": {"text": "305 8.3 Preparing the manuscript\nthe American and British spellings ( labor  versus labour ). Either form is generally \naccepted provided the choices are applied consistently throughout a manuscript. \nDictionaries teach in other ways. A dictionary is a good source to determine if a \nword is capitalized ( Internet ), hyphenated ( e-mail ), not hyphenated ( online ), set as \ntwo words ( screen snap ), or set as a single word ( database ).\nTo facilitate formatting, conferences provide template files, typically in both \nMicrosoft Word and LaTeX formats. The template embeds many of the formatting \nrequirements such as the margin sizes, fonts for headings and text, line spacing, \nparagraph spacing, and so on. Generally, the manuscript is prepared directly in a \nrenamed copy of the template file.\nThe template file also provides instructions and guidance on aspects of the \npaper under control of the author. These include writing style, the preparation of \nfigures and other visual aids, formatting for citations and references, etc.\n8.3.2  Citations and references\nCitations and references are the connections that tie research together. Research \nsubmissions (e.g., for CHI) have formatting requirements for citations and refer -\nence lists. This is one area where HCI conferences generally deviate from the APA \nguidelines. The following is a quick view into the formatting of citations and refer -\nences for conference submissions to CHI and many other HCI conferences.\n8.3.2.1 Reference list\nFigure 8.6  illustrates the formatting for five common types of publications in refer -\nence lists in HCI conference proceedings: a conference paper, a journal paper, a \nbook, a chapter in an edited book, and an Internet document.\nCiting web pages or documents downloaded from the Internet as the primary \nsource for research is discouraged. However, if a relevant source is only available on \nthe web or as a downloadable document, then it is reasonable to cite it. Unfortunately, \nthere are not yet standardized rules for citing and referencing these sources. The \nexample in Figure 8.6  includes four items: the source (e.g., author or organization), \nthe title (set in italics), the URL, and the date the document was accessed.\nThe following is a checklist of common formatting rules for reference lists in \nconference publications:\nl References are numbered.\nl References are ordered alphabetically by first author\u2019s surname.\nl For each author, the surname comes first, followed a comma, then the initials for \nthe given names. Include a space between the initials if there is more than one \n(e.g., \u201cSmith, B. A.\u201d not \u201cSmith, B.A.\u201d).\nl For the title of the publication, only capitalize the first word, the first word in a \nsecondary title (e.g., after a colon), and proper nouns.\n4 Online versions are at www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary  and http://oxforddictionaries.com .", "doc_id": "e04f8774-0fa0-43ca-afc7-8bcf4dc0166d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea31c4457eff26cfa189fb489a186786b4909824e31f2755c7b70a1d1f89dfaa", "extra_info": {"page_label": "305", "file_name": "3-s2.0-B978012405865100008X-main.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2883}, "relationships": {"1": "6220a53e-e6ac-487f-9aa2-e7e2ae4066a3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c0b8b7f-3119-46da-96d8-9319f7bf5244": {"__data__": {"text": "306 CHAPTER 8  Writing and Publishing a Research Paper \nl Always include the year.

Thompson \nReuters\u2019 EndNote  (www.endnote.com ) is a tool that greatly simplifies that task. \nIt works with a bibliographic database and a plug-in for word processors such as \nMicrosoft Word. With EndNote, inserting a citation is as simple as copy (from the \ndatabase) and paste (at the desired location in the manuscript). Formatting the bib -\nliography is typically done by an option in the Tools menu or EndNote ribbon. The \nprocess formats both the citations within the manuscript and the references list at \nthe end. Numerous styles are included with EndNote and they are easy to customize \naccording to the submission requirements of a conference or journal.\n8.3.3  Visual aids\nVisual aids are powerful tools for conveying ideas and results. Few areas in experi -\nmental research have gained more from technological advances than the methods \nand tools for displaying results. Charts, tables, graphs, drawings, and photographs \nare now fully in the digital domain, with sophisticated tools for editing and styliz -\ning the presentation.5\nOne of the most common results to present is the effect of an independent varia -\nble on a dependent variable. A bar chart is usually the most appropriate format, since \nmost independent variables are nominal-scale attributes. An example is shown in \nFigure 8.7a . The chart shows the results of Zhu et al.\u2019s experiment on teleoperation \n(Zhu, Gedeon, and Taylor, 2011). Participants used a scene camera while manipu -\nlating a robot arm to nudge rocks into a hole. The independent variable was cam -\nera control model (manual, natural, auto). The dependent variable was the number \nof rocks sunk in a specified time interval. As seen in the figure, the natural model \nperformed best. (This was confirmed in an analysis of variance.) Note the presence \nof error bars. Error bars are an important reminder to the reader of variability in \nhuman responses. However, error bars add little insight unless they are appropriately \nlabeled, for example, in the figure\u2019s caption (which was not the case in Zhu et al.\u2019s \npaper).\nIf the variable shown along the x-axis is continuous, then a line chart is appro -\npriate. In Zhu et al.\u2019s experiment on teleoperation, participants proceeded under a \ntime constraint. An additional result was provided on the number of rocks sunk in \neach of three 60-second intervals. (See Figure 8.7b .) The lines between intervals \nconvey a sense of continuity as the experiment trials progressed.\nWell before the Results and Discussion section, visuals are an important adjunct \nto text. Visuals can clarify concepts about the research or the technical details of an \napparatus. In preparing a manuscript, try to find opportunities to assist the reader \nwherever possible. The methodology in particular can benefit from a judicious \nand targeted use of visuals.

Effective communication \ndemands clarity: \u201ca clear mind attacking a clearly stated problem and producing \nclearly stated conclusions\u201d (Day and Gastel, 2006, pp. 3\u20134). Clarity comes with \neconomy\u2014saying what needs to be said and little else. This theme appears in the \nACM SIGCHI\u2019s template for research papers.6 The template includes a section \ncalled \u201cLanguage, Style, and Content,\u201d with recommendations organized in a bul -\nleted list. The list begins:\nl Write in a straightforward style.\nl Avoid long or complex sentence structures.\nSo the goal in writing a research paper is to organize and deliver the story of the \nresearch in sentences that are simple and straightforward. This seems simple and \nstraightforward. But it isn\u2019t. Writing with clarity and economy is a challenge that is \nnever fully achieved. Even the most seasoned researcher continuously struggles to \nexpress ideas in the clearest and most succinct way possible. The guard must never \nbe down, lest the prose enlarge and swell.\nWriting with clarity is both a craft and an art. The craft is driven by rules, rigor, \nand precision. The art is creative, engaging human qualities such as imagination, \ninspiration, ingenuity, and originality. Succeeding at both, and with a balance that \nretains economy while delivering style, is a challenge. However, unlike fictional \nwriting, the balance for scholarly writing leans toward craft. In scholarly writing, \nclarity trumps all.\nIt is outside the scope of this book to teach either the craft or art of scholarly \nwriting. The topics include sentence structure, grammar, tense, flow, tone, continu -\nity, economy of expression, and so on. It is a huge assignment. Besides, excellent \nsources on these and related themes already exist. Four sources are recommended \nbelow. The first three address scholarly writing as well as the methodology in \nexperimental research. The fourth is the classic \u201cStrunk and White,\u201d first published \nin 1919.

A profusion of words that fills space \nbut adds nothing is certain to suffocate any research paper. Without doubt, the \nreader who faces a stream of added useless words will quickly tire. The superflu -\nous words demand the reader\u2019s attention\u2014so as not to miss a point\u2014but in the end \nthey encumber rather than enlighten. Every source on writing style has a take on \nthis subject. Strunk and White\u2019s Rule #17 is to Omit Needless Words: \u201cA sentence \nshould contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for \nthe same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no \nunnecessary parts\u201d (Strunk and White, 2000, p. 23). The APA\u2019s Publication Manual  \nis more pedantic: \u201cYou can tighten long papers by eliminating redundancy, wordi -\nness, jargon, evasiveness, overuse of the passive voice, circumlocution, and clumsy \nprose\u201d (APA, 2010, p. 67).\nA sampling of edits in view of Strunk and White\u2019s Rule #17 is found in Figure \n8.10. The examples are real. They are from a much larger collection compiled by \nthis book\u2019s author over many years while editing, co-authoring, or reviewing HCI \nmanuscripts. In each case, redundant words are removed. The revised phrase is suc -\ncinct. It delivers the same point with less energy demanded of the reader.\nThere is little to gain in analyzing each revision in Figure 8.10 . Perhaps one \nobservation is worthwhile, however: user studies that are written about in the past \ntense have already been conducted . Furthermore, they were conducted in the past . \nSee the last example in the figure. Yes, every sentence should be parsed in this man -\nner. Break it down. Get rid of every word that fails to contribute. The result is clar -\nity and economy\u2014a better manuscript.\nWhen preparing the initial draft of a manuscript, relax. First and foremost, get \nthe words and ideas down and into the manuscript. It would be nice if the editing \nthat produced the revisions in Figure 8.10  surfaced in the first draft. But this is not \nlikely and it needn\u2019t be attempted. Few writers are gifted enough to produce crisp \nprose in the first pass. So don\u2019t struggle to make the initial draft the final draft. But \nbefore submitting the manuscript, give it every ounce of editing that time permits. \nThe reviewers will appreciate it, and the result may ultimately\u2014and hopefully\u2014\nachieve that final and essential step in research: a publication. Congratulations and \ngood luck.\nSTUDENT EXERCISES\n8-1. Use Google Scholar or the ACM Digital Library to locate several research \npapers from a recent conference proceedings.

In the latter case, \nmore reliable information is obtained since participants are more engaged and \ncan ask for clarification.\nSo what data are of interest? A questionnaire usually begins by asking \nsimple demographic information such as age and gender. Also solicit more \nspecific information relevant to the topic, such as first language spoken, num -\nber of hours per day using a computer, hours per day playing video games, \npreferred browser (IE versus Firefox), preferred computer type (Mac versus \nPC), number of tweets sent per day, preferred texting method (multi-tap ver -\nsus T9), estimated typing speed, and so on.

Social touch has been studied extensively\nin psychology and neuroscience. With the development of new technologies it is now possible to engage in social touch at a distance\nor engage in social touch with arti\ufb01cial social agents. Social touch research has inspired research into technology mediated social\ntouch, and this line of research has found effects similar to actual social touch. The importance of haptic stimulus qualities, multimodal\ncues, and contextual factors in technology mediated social touch is discussed. This survey is concluded by re\ufb02ecting on the current\nstate of research into social touch technology, and providing suggestions for future research and applications.\nIndex Terms\u2014Haptics and haptic interfaces; Social touch; Affective touch; Medaited social touch; Simulated social touch\nF\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nTHEway we interact with our digital devices, such as\nlaptops, smart phones, and tablets is mainly through\nour visual and auditory senses. When we think of using our\nsense of touch in such interactions, images of clicking mouse\nbuttons, and sliding our \ufb01ngers over a glass display spring\nto mind. The \ufb01eld of haptics is concerned with investigating\nhuman-machine communication through the sense of touch\n[1], in interactions where we can not only use our sense of\ntouch for input, but also receive computer generated touch\noutput.\nResearch into haptics has mainly focussed on addressing\nthe discriminative aspects of the human sense of touch.\nThese discriminative aspects relate to the use of the human\nsense of touch as an exteroceptive organ, that can detect,\ndiscriminate, and identify stimuli outside the body in order\nto guide behavior [2]. Haptic interfaces can be used to\nprovide information about the state of a system through the\nuser\u2019s sense of touch in order to allow the user to make\ndecisions based on this information [1][3]. Applications of\nsuch interfaces are found in remote operation, such as\nremote surgery [4], haptic navigation systems, for example\nfor helicopter pilots [5], and haptic warning systems, such\nas lane departure warnings in cars [6].\nApart from its discriminative function, the human sense\nof touch also serves an important interoceptive, affective\nfunction [2]. Hedonic aspects of the human sense of touch\nare easily understood when thinking about unpleasant (e.g.\nthe feeling of sandpaper on the skin), or painful sensations\non the one hand, and pleasant sensations (e.g. the feeling\nof silk on the skin) or stimulation of erogenous zones on\nthe other hand [7]. However, when we think of the most\naffect laden forms of touch, being touched by another per-\nson (not necessarily in a sexual way) is perhaps the most\npowerful affective signal.

Although it occurs less frequently than other social\nsignals, such as facial expressions, the use of social touch\nis diverse, ranging form use during greetings, to showing\naffection and support [11], and social touch can profoundly\nin\ufb02uence social interactions [7]. For example, touch can lead\nto more favorable evaluations of the toucher [12], can serve\na persuasive function [13], and can ful\ufb01ll an important role\nin the regulation of physical and emotional wellbeing [14].\nAs the \ufb01rst sense to develop in the womb [15][16], touch is\nvital for the bonding between mother and child [17], and\nremains highly important in later social life [7].\nFrom a technological point of view, haptic technology\nhas the capability of emulating aspects of human touch,\nsuch as applying force or warmth. However, when such\nsensations are used in haptic interactions aimed at social\ncommunication, that is, using haptics for social touch, a\nwhole new layer of complexity is added. The way any social\ntouch is interpreted, is for example dependent on the type\nof touch [18], the body location it is applied to [19], as well\nas relational [20][21], cultural [22], and broader contextual\nfactors [23].\nThe aim of this survey is to shed light on the complexities\nof using haptic technology for social touch. The use of\nhaptic technology for social touch interactions is referred\nto here as social touch technology (STT). STT includes\nsituations where human communication partners engage in\nsocial touch mediated through technology [8], as well as\nsituations where humans interact with arti\ufb01cial social agents\nthat have the capability of responding to, and/or applying\nsocial touches [24][25].\nNote that the present survey differs from two previously\npublished surveys on related topics [8][25]. First, the present\nsurvey should be seen as an update to the survey on medi-\nated social touch by Haans and Ijsselsteijn [8] from 2006, in\nthat here, an updated list of prototypes, and new empirical\nresearch on mediated social touch are included.

This survey will\nconclude by re\ufb02ecting on the current state of STT research\nand by providing directions for future research.\n2 T HE HUMAN SENSE OF TOUCH\nIn this section the distinction between discriminative and\naffective touch is outlined, and it is discussed what this\ndistinction means for STT.\n2.1 Discriminative touch\nAn important function of the human sense of touch is to\nobtain information about the external world. Functionally,\na distinction can be made between the kinesthetic and\ncutaneous senses [26][27]. The kinesthetic sense provides\ninformation about the position of limbs in time and space,\nand information about muscular effort to the central ner-\nvous system in order to guide body movement [27]. Force-\nfeedback type haptic interfaces, exerting forces on the limbs\nof a user, address the kinesthetic sense, though receptors in\nthe skin are also stimulated. The cutaneous sense provides\nthe central nervous system with information from a range\nof different receptors found in the skin. For example, vibro-\ntactile actuators can stimulate speci\ufb01c types of mechanore-\nceptors (i.e. receptors that detect skin deformation) that are\nsensitive to certain vibration frequencies. A large body of\nwork (see [28] for a review) has focussed on cutaneous\nreceptors in the glabrous skin (i.e. hairless skin) found in\nthe hand and \ufb01ngers. Particularly the \ufb01ngers contain a\nhigh density of low-threshold mechanoreceptors with fast\nconducting afferent nerves (i.e. nerve carrying information\nto the central nervous system) [2][28]. The high density of\nfast conducting mechanoreceptors makes the \ufb01ngers andhands", "doc_id": "6534a92f-f1ec-4362-90cd-5fd390245232", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b9e1ea78d9d72a3fc8e3fc80987e2d107913d37bc41bba519a9b29c70cae2afc", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3746}, "relationships": {"1": "a8e1c884-0694-4a20-9d6b-bbeae96f5fe6", "3": "f6f19a31-2cf9-43ca-85b0-c8c2a16230f5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6f19a31-2cf9-43ca-85b0-c8c2a16230f5": {"__data__": {"text": "receptors found in the skin.

The high density of\nfast conducting mechanoreceptors makes the \ufb01ngers andhands ideal for discriminative touch, and allows the \ufb01ngers\nto, for example, detect the textures of an object [29].\n2.2 Affective touch and the social touch hypothesis\nThe neurophysiology underlying discriminative touch is\nrelatively well understood in terms of receptors, pathways\nto the brain, and perception [30]. This knowledge of discrim-\ninative touch has helped advance research into haptics, and\nthe design of haptic interfaces [1][3]. However, researchers\nhave only recently begun to unravel the neurophysiology of\na secondary touch system, hypothesized to underlie social\nand affective touch [31][32][33].\nThe hairy skin, which covers most of the human body,\nhas a lower density of fast conducting receptors than the\nhand and \ufb01ngers [2][34]. However, only the hairy skin is\ninnervated by a class of low threshold, unmyelinated (thus\nslow conducting) C Tactile (CT) afferents [35]. CT afferents\noffer poor spatial and temporal resolution, and are therefore\nnot well suited for discriminative touch [32][34]. It has\nbeen found that CT afferents respond particularly strongly\nto gentle, stroking touches with \ufb01ring rates following an\ninverted U-curve shape as a function of stroking velocity,\nand peaking at about 3cm/s [36]. Moreover, subjective rat-\nings of the pleasantness of such touches follow a similar\ninverted U-curve shape, with stroking stimuli rated the most\npleasant at a velocity of 3cm/s [34][36][37][38]. In addition,\nCT afferents project mainly to the insula, an area of the\nbrain implicated in processing affect, whereas receptors for\ndiscriminative touch mainly project to the somatosensory\ncortices [2][32][34]. These \ufb01ndings have lead researchers to\npropose the social touch hypothesis [32][33], which states\nthat CT afferents might serve as a \u201c\ufb01lter\u201d, that operates\nin conjunction with other mechanoreceptors (i.e. those for\ndiscriminative touch) in order to help determine if a certain\ntouch has social relevance or not [32][33]. This hypothesis is\nsupported by the notion that caressing touches to which CT\nafferents are sensitive, are particularly pertinent in af\ufb01liative\ninteractions between humans [32][34][36][38]. This may be\nespecially the case between mothers and infants [15][17][39].\nWhat is more, CT afferents respond most vigorously to\nstroking touches applied by a stimulus at skin temperature\n[40].\nThus, there is a dedicated pathway that underlies affec-\ntive touch, and that is distinct from discriminative touch.\nNevertheless it should be appreciated that in social touch\ninteractions, both discriminative and affective touch systems\nplay a role [2]. Many different types of touch are used in\nsocial touch interactions that do not involve stroking of the\nskin, but involve CT non-optimal touches (e.g.", "doc_id": "f6f19a31-2cf9-43ca-85b0-c8c2a16230f5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "195bf58dc7c9e7f4b8aa4f3f44f1732526536728efc09581c734a49510c34cde", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3192, "end": 6573}, "relationships": {"1": "a8e1c884-0694-4a20-9d6b-bbeae96f5fe6", "2": "6534a92f-f1ec-4362-90cd-5fd390245232", "3": "82ddb1cc-501f-4e6b-b01e-ab2b9e00c443"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "82ddb1cc-501f-4e6b-b01e-ab2b9e00c443": {"__data__": {"text": "to which CT\nafferents are sensitive, are particularly pertinent in af\ufb01liative\ninteractions between humans [32][34][36][38].

In these\nsituations, the physical aspects of a social touch are detected\nprimarily through receptors important for discriminative\ntouch.\nProcessing of pleasant touch through the affective touch\nCT pathway is considered an innate non-learned process\n[2], yet it should be noted that the perception of pleasant\nstroking touches can be modulated by cognitive processes,", "doc_id": "82ddb1cc-501f-4e6b-b01e-ab2b9e00c443", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "63f35f0c4bf405f8dd76353bca66fcd85b009695e9ff92e761c51df54970e461", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 6406, "end": 7734}, "relationships": {"1": "a8e1c884-0694-4a20-9d6b-bbeae96f5fe6", "2": "f6f19a31-2cf9-43ca-85b0-c8c2a16230f5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae5875b5-12e9-466a-87d2-8686916e2397": {"__data__": {"text": "1939-1412 (c) 2016 IEEE.

[18] found that stroking with a human hand compared\nto with a velvet stick resulted in larger responses in both\nsensory and affect related brain regions, and higher subjec-\ntive pleasantness ratings. This difference is possibly due to\na combination of perceptual differences (i.e. a human hand\nactually feels different from a velvet stick) and cognitive and\nemotional correlates of being touched by another person\n[18]. In addition, CT optimal stroking touches observed\nfrom a video can result in similar activation of the posterior\ninsula as received CT optimal stroking touches, but only\nwhen the observed touch occurs in a social setting [45]. Self\nreports of pleasantness also showed similarities between\nfelt and observed CT optimal touch, thus it seems that\nvisual cues of both the type of touch as well as the social\nsetting in\ufb02uence affective touch perception [45]. Neverthe-\nless, Willemse et al. [46] found that pleasantness ratings of\nobserved stroking touch to a human arm, showed a similar\nresponse pattern for stroking with an actual human hand,\nmannequin arm, robot arm, and plastic tube. This would\nsuggest that the interpretation of the social setting may be\nmore dependent on the recipient than on the stimulus that\napplies the touch.\nIn the present survey social touch is considered to in-\nvolve both discriminative and affective touch systems work-\ning in tandem. The affective touch system may be especially\nrelevant for the innate processing of social touch, but only\nfor a small subset of touches (i.e. stroking touches). A much\nbroader range of social touches is detected through the dis-\ncriminative touch system, but a more cognitively involved\nprocess is required to derive social and affective meaning\nfrom such touches (see also [2]). In the following sections\nwe will discuss social touch interactions that involve both\ndiscriminative and affective touch systems, and we will\nhighlight important factors that in\ufb02uence the perception of\nsocial touches through both systems. We start by outlining\nhow social touch can affect the toucher and recipient of the\ntouch in the next section.\n3 E FFECTS OF SOCIAL TOUCH\nIn order to get a more detailed picture of how haptic inter-\nfaces might be used for social touch in all its varieties, it is\nimportant to \ufb01rst consider what effects unmediated human-\nhuman social touch can have. In this section we will discuss\neffects of social touch on four relevant topics that have been\nidenti\ufb01ed in the literature, namely: physical and emotional\nwellbeing, attachment and bonding, attitude and behavior\nchange, and communication of affect.\n3.1 Physical and emotional wellbeing\nSocial touch is considered important for the proper devel-\nopment of infants, as a lack of touch in the early stages of an\ninfant\u2019s life can have negative consequences for the infant\u2019s\nwellbeing later on (for a review see [47]). Observations\nfrom orphans deprived of social and sensory stimulation,\nrevealed these children to be lacking in cognitive, emotional,\nand social development [48][49][50].

Observations\nfrom orphans deprived of social and sensory stimulation,\nrevealed these children to be lacking in cognitive, emotional,\nand social development [48][49][50]. While it is dif\ufb01cult to\nisolate the effects of a lack of touch from those of generaldeprivation, some argue that the lack of social touch con-\ntributes strongly to negative effects on infant development\nfound in orphans [15][16]. Indeed, caring maternal touch\nhas a positive impact on neurological development of low-\nbirthweight infants, resulting in greater visual-motor skill\ndevelopment later on [51]. Touch, either used in combina-\ntion with other stimuli [52] or used on its own [53] has been\nfound to reduce physical discomfort and pain in infants\nundergoing painful medical procedures. Maternal touch has\npositive effects on infants\u2019 stress response and recovery from\nstress, measured as cardiac vagal tone and cortisol (a stress\nhormone) levels [54], and may be bene\ufb01cial for the mother\ntoo [54], as a co-regulation process with the infant takes\nplace [55]. It is worthwhile to note here that massaging, a\nmore intense form of touch, may offer additional bene\ufb01ts to\ninfants, (for a review see [56]), and may also help children\nsuffering from af\ufb02ictions in the autism spectrum disorder\n(ASD) [57], who are typically aversive to being touched\n[15][58][59].\nPositive effects of social touch on physical and emo-\ntional wellbeing are also pertinent in later life, especially\nfor individuals in romantic relationships. Holding one\u2019s\npartner\u2019s hand, rather than holding an object or stranger\u2019s\nhand, when receiving a painful stimulus results in lower\npain ratings [60]. Partner contact in the form of hand\nholding, hugging, or massaging prior to a stressful task,\nresults in lower stress responses measured through cortisol\nlevels, blood pressure and heart rate [61][62]. Such effects\nof touch on stress responses are stronger for touch between\nspouses, as compared to receiving touch from a stranger,\nand may be in\ufb02uenced by marital quality [63]. Moreover,\nshort-term effects of partner contact may be stronger for\nthose individuals who receive more partner hugs in general\n[64]. Higher levels of oxytocin (a \u201csocial bonding\u201d hormone)\nmay be a predictor of such frequent contact, and potentially\nmediate short-term positive effects of partner contact [64].\nFrequent partner contact over longer periods of time is\nrelated to positive affect and psychological wellbeing [65],\nand is related to a lower risk of infection with the common\ncold virus [66].\nSocial touch by a stranger can also lower a person\u2019s\nheart rate [67], and such effects can be bene\ufb01cial for stress\nreduction in health care settings.

Still, children who are less frequently touched by their\nparents, score higher on reports of current depression and\nshow less secure attachment styles in later life [76].\nConversely, a person\u2019s attachment style can predict their\nfeelings towards touch in both romantic, and parent-child\nrelationships [77]. Individuals with a less secure attachment\nstyle have been found to have more negative feelings to-\nwards cuddling in both types of relationships [77]. Miller\net al. [78] studied college student\u2019s responses to images\ndescribed as depicting their partners engaged in touch of\ndifferent intimacy levels with an opposite-sex friend. More\nintimate types of touch (i.e. touch to the torso) resulted\nin stronger feelings of jealousy overall, but especially for\nfemale participants, and individuals with less secure attach-\nment styles.\nThe concept of attachment is closely related to other\nconcepts relating to interpersonal relationships, such as\nlove and intimacy [79], and attachment theory has long\nsince been recognized as a framework for explaining adult\nromantic attachment [80]. Non-sexual physical affection is\npositively correlated with relationship and partner satisfac-\ntion, and can help with con\ufb02ict resolution within romantic\ncouples [81]. The bonding aspect of social touch within cou-\nples, may be mediated by the release of oxytocin that results\nfrom being touched [82][83][84]. Oxytocin is a hormone that\nhas been implicated in bonding behavior of mammals, and\nis released during physical contact, such as grooming [85].\nLight et al.

This suggests that\nsocial touch, possibly mediated by the release of oxytocin,\naids couples in the forming of lasting social (romantic)\nbonds [86].\n3.3 Attitude and behavior change\nSocial touch has the potential to in\ufb02uence the attitude and\nbehavior of the person receiving the touch. A brief touch to\nthe hand, arm, or shoulder can positively in\ufb02uence attitudes\ntowards the toucher [12][20][87][88], the affective state of the\nrecipient of the touch [87], and attitudes towards the setting\nin which the touch takes place [87][88].\nBesides resulting in changes in the attitude of the recipi-\nent of a touch, social touch can also impact the behavior of\nthe recipient. An oft studied phenomenon in social touch\nresearch is the Midas touch effect [13] which describes\nthe positive effects of social touch on pro-social behavior.\nThis effect has been demonstrated in numerous ecologically\nvalid settings, with a diverse range of observed pro-social\nbehaviors. The Midas touch effect can result in increases in\nwillingness to return lost money [89], increases in restaurant\ntipping after a touch by a waitress [13][88][90], enhanced\ncompliance to menu item", "doc_id": "0e4b9373-67fe-406d-87f1-56a0bd23f918", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "29e18daec5c68b698599c38211e81d78adb30774347fa077583c226b5d949112", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3716}, "relationships": {"1": "174d61db-97e7-48a3-9426-ca065f20495e", "3": "a2e8ffd8-0f87-4f48-b67a-a9a765108c25"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2e8ffd8-0f87-4f48-b67a-a9a765108c25": {"__data__": {"text": "the affective state of the\nrecipient of the touch [87], and attitudes towards the setting\nin which the touch takes place [87][88].\nBesides resulting in changes in the attitude of the recipi-\nent of a touch, social touch can also impact the behavior of\nthe recipient.

The Midas touch effect can result in increases in\nwillingness to return lost money [89], increases in restaurant\ntipping after a touch by a waitress [13][88][90], enhanced\ncompliance to menu item suggestions in a restaurant after a\ntouch by a waiter or waitress [91], and in\ufb02uence purchase\ndecisions [88]. Other \ufb01ndings include that a brief touch tothe forearm increases the chances that people will spon-\ntaneously help to pick up dropped items [92], increases\nthe chances that students will volunteer to write down an\nanswer on the blackboard during class [93], increases the\ntime that participants are willing to spend on a repetitive\ntask, such as \ufb01lling out bogus personality questionnaire\nitems [94], and increases the likelihood people will give their\nopinion on dif\ufb01cult social issues [95]. In health care settings,\nresearch has shown that a touch by a medical practitioner\nincreases the chances that a patient will adhere to their\nmedication [96], and touch by caregivers in an elderly home\ncan result in increases in calorie and protein intake by the\nelderly [97].\nThe Midas touch effect may be in\ufb02uenced by character-\nistics of the toucher and the person who is touched. Touch\nby physically more attractive people has a stronger positive\neffect on pro-social behavior [20][88]. In addition, touch by\na female seems to have a stronger positive impact on pro-\nsocial behavior than touch by a male, for both male and\nfemale recipients [98][99]. Moreover, effects of touch on pro-\nsocial behavior may depend on the type of request. Touch\nmay especially affect compliance for moderate requests,\nsuch as \ufb01lling out a survey [99], but may have little effect for\nvery easy (signing a petition) [99] or very dif\ufb01cult (signing\nup to become a blood donor) [100] requests. Finally, touch\ncan also negatively impact pro-social behavior, when it is\napplied in a competitive rather than supportive context [23].\nInterestingly the Midas touch effect occurs after very\nbrief (<1 sec.) contact, and occurs whether the recipient\nof the touch is aware of being touched or not [101]. It is\ncurrently not clear what accounts for the Midas touch effect\nexactly. One suggestion is that the touch is interpreted by the\nreceiver as a signal that the toucher likes and trusts him/her,\nwhich is reciprocated by the receiver in the form of pro-\nsocial behavior [9]. Another explanation is that touch serves\nas a signal for power and status differences, resulting in the\nrecipient of a touch to be more compliant [23][94]. However,\nthis offers little explanation for \ufb01ndings where enhanced\npro-social behavior was found for participants unaware of\nbeing touched [101]. Possibly, increases in oxytocin levels\nas a result of being touched, support cooperative behavior\n[102]. Finally, some argue that Midas touch studies suffer\nfrom confederate bias [89][103][104], where the confederate\nthat applies the touch also, unwillingly, adjusts other social\ncues such as their gaze [89], which may impact pro-social\nbehavior.\n3.4 Communication of affect\nTouch can directly in\ufb02uence affect through erogenous zones\nand nociceptors (i.e.", "doc_id": "a2e8ffd8-0f87-4f48-b67a-a9a765108c25", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b9700408c9c935e3a7a1433045b552a35d4274d78ddc07df6fd6763b0b3248db", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3072, "end": 6734}, "relationships": {"1": "174d61db-97e7-48a3-9426-ca065f20495e", "2": "0e4b9373-67fe-406d-87f1-56a0bd23f918", "3": "8c8b7d37-9b8b-4e58-9c89-fdcba118006e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c8b7d37-9b8b-4e58-9c89-fdcba118006e": {"__data__": {"text": "power and status differences, resulting in the\nrecipient of a touch to be more compliant [23][94].

The body location to which\nsuch mother-infant touch is applied can elicit affective re-\nsponses in the infant, such as negative responses to being\ntouched on the abdomen [106]. Furthermore, in mother-\ninfant interactions, stroking touches have been found to\nelicit more positive responses from infants, than either pok-\ning or tickling touches [107].\nTouch does not only communicate positive or negative\naffective states, but the nature of the touch itself can be used", "doc_id": "8c8b7d37-9b8b-4e58-9c89-fdcba118006e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "315b1b6c7d5e981bd7a2084a3e354519c25c139385bd3f8707e0f8170901af67", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 6678, "end": 7983}, "relationships": {"1": "174d61db-97e7-48a3-9426-ca065f20495e", "2": "a2e8ffd8-0f87-4f48-b67a-a9a765108c25"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "22624c4f-b5bd-4802-9b3e-1116906d3830": {"__data__": {"text": "1939-1412 (c) 2016 IEEE.

[41] participants were able to communicate, by\nonly touching the forearm of another person, a number\nof emotions at above chance level, with recognition rates\nsimilar to those found in research into facial expressions.\nSpeci\ufb01c touches were related to the communication of cer-\ntain emotions. For example, anger was communicated by\nhitting, squeezing, or trembling, whereas love was mostly\ncommunicated by stroking, \ufb01nger interlocking, and rubbing\n[41]. Moreover, when the entire body was available to touch,\nadditional emotions could be communicated [108]. In a later\nreanalysis of the arm-only study [41] it was found that\nsome of the recognition rates were dependent upon speci\ufb01c\ngender combinations in the encoder-decoder dyads [109].\nFinally, App et al. [110] found that touch was preferred over\nfacial, or bodily expressions, for the expression of intimate\nemotions such as sympathy and love, and that these emo-\ntions, expressed through touch, were better recognized than\nthrough other modalities.\nFrom the previous it can be gathered that effects of social\ntouch are widespread and profound. Social touch affects life\nin all stages, from the earliest moments of child develop-\nment, to building a healthy parent-infant relationship, not\nto mention later romantic attachments. However, the exact\neffects that a social touch may have regarding each of the\nfour discussed topics, may depend on the type of touch, the\ninteraction partners\u2018 relation, age, and gender, and may be\nmediated by the release of oxytocine. All of these aspects\nprovide signi\ufb01cant challenges to translating effects of social\ntouch to STT. The next section will cover how STT research\nto date has dealt with these challenges.\n4 M EDIATED SOCIAL TOUCH\nResearch into actual social touch, as well as advances in hap-\ntic technology, have inspired researchers to investigate how\nhaptic technology can be used for social communication at\na distance (see [111] for some of the earliest work). This line\nof research is referred to as mediated social touch [8]. Haans\nand Ijsselsteijn de\ufb01ne mediated social touch as \u201cthe ability\nof one actor to touch another actor over a distance by means\nof tactile or kinesthetic feedback technology\u201d [8, p. 153].\nMediated social touch is somewhat of an oxymoron, because\nsocial touch by its very nature requires physical proximity\n(see also [112] for a discussion of multisensory integration\nand physical proximity). Thus, there are differences between\nactual social touch and mediated social touch that need\nto be taken into consideration. First, unlike actual social\ntouch, mediated social touch is not necessarily reciprocal,\nand the touch sensation perceived by the sender can be very\ndifferent from that perceived by the receiver (e.g. pressing\na force sensor that controls vibrotactile actuators [113]).\nSecond, unlike actual social touch, mediated social touch\ncan occur asynchronously. It is technically possible for a\ntouch to be stored and received at a time later than when\nit was applied and sent.

Third, mediated social touch is less\nsensory rich than actual social touch, not just in terms of\ncutaneous and kinesthetic feedback, but also in terms of\nfeedback from other modalities which may not necessarily\nbe present in mediated social touch.Mediated social touch requires detection of a touch on\nthe end of the sender, and rendering of the touch at the\nend of the receiver. The sender needs to be aware of the\nfact that his/her input causes a physical sensation at the\nreceiver\u2019s end, while the receiver needs to believe that\nthe felt sensation is caused by the sender. This process of\nattribution (see also [114]) is aided by feedback from other\nmodalities, such as visual feedback from the input device\n[115], the way the source of the haptic feedback is framed\n(e.g. purposefully applied by the sender or not [116]), as\nwell as the sensory \ufb01delity of the received feedback (i.e. to\nwhat extent it feels like an actual human touch)[117].\nIn the next sections we discuss how these elements\nare represented in the design of prototypes, and to what\nextent these elements contribute to effects of mediated social\ntouch. We will start in the next section by providing a brief\noverview of sensors and actuators for use in mediated social\ntouch.\n4.1 Sensing and reproducing touches\nThere are various types of touch sensors that have the\ncapability to detect certain features of a human touch. Sen-\nsors that can detect touches on a skin-like surface emulate\nthe human cutaneous sense [118][119][120]. Such sensors\ncan typically detect the location, duration and intensity of\na touch, and, using machine learning techniques, can be\nused for automatic classi\ufb01cation of social touch gestures\n[119][120]. Other types of sensors can determine the position\nof an individual\u2019s limbs in time and space, akin to how\nthe human kinesthetic sense works. One technique involves\nmeasuring the position of a person\u2019s limbs by attaching\nsensors directly to the body [121]. Another technique is to\nuse sensors in the joints of force-feedback joysticks to derive\nthe position of a person\u2019s limbs when interacting with the\njoystick [122][123].\nWhile not yet capable of delivering the exact sensory\nqualities of a human touch, speci\ufb01c actuators can stimu-\nlate receptors for both discriminative and affective touch.\nFor example, vibrotactile [124], air pressure [125], or pur-\nposefully designed mechanical stimuli [117], can stimulate\ndifferent mechanoreceptors. Actuators capable of producing\na slow stroking motion over the skin [117], could be used\nto stimulate CT afferents in order to address the affective\ntouch system. Still, there is research that suggests that\nstroking stimuli can also be generated with a vibrotactile\narray, and that pleasantness responses to such stroking may\nbe perceived similar to actual stroking [126]. Speci\ufb01cally\ndesigned haptic stimuli using actuation methods such as\nrotational friction, air puffs, and vibration can also be used\nto elicit affective responses in the recipients of the feedback,\nand for affective communication [127][128][129][130].", "doc_id": "ea363d0c-bd56-45aa-84a1-d62b73cb38f3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b3b284ba2f0e9773b2aa0ab1d4e166eb0648b44c43e1b70bc9ab98b5ddfe435a", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3045, "end": 6775}, "relationships": {"1": "701db9d5-8bc7-4f29-8db7-dfc0d24f78d1", "2": "22624c4f-b5bd-4802-9b3e-1116906d3830", "3": "90105c94-66f4-4b81-92a2-c767e1d50e30"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90105c94-66f4-4b81-92a2-c767e1d50e30": {"__data__": {"text": "[124], air pressure [125], or pur-\nposefully designed mechanical stimuli [117], can stimulate\ndifferent mechanoreceptors.

For each prototype a number of elements is\nlisted that are important in actual social touch interactions[11][41][159], as well as elements especially relevant to me-\ndiated social touch, such as actuation types, and the use\nof additional modalities. Categories relating to the use of\ntouch in naturalistic settings [11] were used to describe\nthe meaning of the touches emulated by the prototypes.\nTo this categorization we added a category \u201csymbolic\u201d to\ndenote devices for which the meaning of a touch arises\nfrom a shared symbolism that is not necessarily found in\nactual social touch interactions. Prototypes were selected\non the basis of three criteria. First, prototypes should have\na real functioning haptic component in them. Second, the\nprototypes should be aimed at social interactions. Third, the\nprototypes should feature a form of input and output that\nrepresents social touch in some way (see also [115] on the\nimportance of perceived input modality).\nA number of general observations1can be made from the\n1.

Another category that\nrepresents a large number of prototypes describes playful\naffectionate touches that serve to lighten the interaction.\nThese interactions occur through devices that offer abstract\nforms of touch [146][148], playful touches such as tickling\n[150][151][152], or through the manipulation of a shared\nobject [147][149]. There are a number of prototypes that\nfeature non-task oriented symbolic tactile communication.\nThese prototypes are for example used to add emphasis\nduring phone conversations [113][155], or to communicate\nabstract representations of different types of touch [158].\nSecond, prototypes stimulate different body areas. Large\nareas of the body are stimulated by devices that emu-\nlate a hugging sensation through vests worn on the torso\n[135][136], devices that the user places on his/her lap\n[132][134], or devices that the user holds to his/her chest\n[133]. The most often stimulated area for all prototypes is\nthe hand. Looking at the types of touches that are emulated\nby different prototypes, it stands out that many touches are\nstatic, applied to a single body location without movement\nover the skin. What is more, vibrotactile actuation, which\ndoes not stimulate CT afferents [160][161][162], is often used\n(though see [126]). It therefore seems that stimulation of CT\nafferents has not been a major concern in the design of many\nprototypes.\nFinally, prototypes for mediated social touch often use\nother modalities in conjunction with touch. In interactions\nwith these prototypes, visual or auditory cues can create a\nsetting in which touches can be used, for example, for emo-\ntional expression [116][132], or adding emphasis to vocal\nutterances [113][155]. Conversely, visual stimuli can be used\nto enhance touch, by showing visual representations of, for\nexample, a hand that applies the mediated touch [144][150].\nStudies have shown that visual representations of a touch\ncan result in responses similar to receiving an actual touch\n[43][45][163], therefore a multi-modal approach, combining\ncongruent visual and tactile feedback, may be particularly\npromising for mediated social touch.\nTo conclude, many different prototypes have been de-\nsigned that offer interesting interaction possibilities, and\nthat demonstrate the technical feasibility of mediated social\ntouch. Though the elements listed in Table 1 are important\nelements in the design of prototypes for mediated social\ntouch, it should be noted that other factors, such as the\ncommunication partner, the broader context of the touch,\nand the timing of the touches, can have a strong impact on\nany potential effects of mediated social touch. These factors\nshould be considered in the design of empirical studies into\nthe effects of mediated social touch, which will be discussed\nin the following section.\n4.3 Empirical studies into mediated social touch\nThere are two general approaches in the empirical inves-\ntigation of mediated social touch (see also [164]).

The \ufb01rst\napproach is characterized by efforts that focus on \ufb01nding\nsimilarities between the way social touch and mediatedsocial touch are experienced. In this line of research the aim\nis to reproduce certain effects of actual human-human social\ntouch (see Section 3) in conditions where the social touch is\nproduced by haptic technology (see also [8] for a discussion\nof this point). The second approach assumes a less direct\nconnection between social touch and mediated social touch.\nHere, the focus is on how novel forms of haptic feedback, or\nnovel applications of haptic feedback, may affect mediated\ninterpersonal communication. In this section we will discuss\nboth approaches starting with the virtual Midas touch effect,\ncommunicating affect through mediated social touch, and\naffective responses to mediated social touch; all topics that\nhave also received attention in unmediated social touch\nresearch. Finally, the use of mediated social touch to enhance\npresence [165], a concept unique to mediated interactions, is\ndiscussed.\n4.3.1 The virtual Midas touch\nThe Midas touch effect describes how a simple touch can\nresult in the recipient of the touch showing more pro-\nsocial behavior towards the person applying the touch [13],\nsuch as helping to pick up dropped items [92]. Similar\ninvestigations have been undertaken in laboratory settings\nwhere the touches were applied through a mediated social\ntouch device. Haans et al. [166] used a \u2018dropped items\u2019\nparadigm, and found that participants who received vibro-\ntactile feedback from a blind confederate (i.e. mediated so-\ncial touch) during a computer chat session, were more likely\nto help pick up coins that the confederate dropped after\nthe chat session, though this difference was not statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant. In an extension of their previous study, Haans\net al. [103] found a signi\ufb01cant difference for participants\nwho received a mediated touch compared to those that\ndid not, in a dropped-items paradigm with a non-blind\nconfederate applying the touches. When, in a second study,\nthe confederate was blind to the experimental condition\n(as in [166]) this signi\ufb01cant difference disappeared. These\n\ufb01ndings suggest that at least part of the virtual Midas touch\neffect is a result of a confederate bias, where the confed-\nerate (unwillingly) adjusts certain behaviors depending on\nthe condition, which may in\ufb02uence a participant\u2019s helping\nbehavior. Interestingly, a meta-analysis of all three virtual\nMidas touch studies revealed an effect size similar to that\nfor the unmediated Midas touch effect [103]. It is likely that\nthe Midas touch effect is subject to a confederate bias as well.\nHaans et al. [103] suggest that using mediated social touch,\nwith the unique ability of allowing for a blind confederate,\ncould aid in shedding light on the extent of the confederate\nbias in the Midas touch effect.\nAnother possibility is that certain types of pro-social be-\nhavior are more strongly affected by a (virtual) Midas touch.\nUsing an ultimatum game paradigm in which participants\nwere made to believe they were negotiating with another\nplayer, while actual decisions", "doc_id": "da796b78-eeef-4801-b2d4-a75698e3e3e1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ffd6825b61b4ed98f4e64848ab8045742348212c5716f6623635905e631341ad", "extra_info": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3105, "end": 7009}, "relationships": {"1": "c0bdb00c-7fa1-4a0f-a9d0-d3f35ce04b71", "2": "16bab112-d7a5-4ae8-bb21-00b9ccf891cd", "3": "7d1a0b40-bc85-4e3c-9936-c1d4b77e81c8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d1a0b40-bc85-4e3c-9936-c1d4b77e81c8": {"__data__": {"text": "which may in\ufb02uence a participant\u2019s helping\nbehavior.

This would have the advantage of al-\nlowing the researcher to control the confederate\u2019s appear-\nance, certain behaviors (e.g. facial expressions), and the\nenvironment in which the touch takes place. Bourdin et\nal. [168] had participants interact with a remotely located\nconfederate in a VR environment. The avatar (i.e. a human-\nlike virtual representation) of the confederate would touch\nthe avatar of the participant and request the participant to\nsing along to a song that was played in the background.\nIn one condition the participant would both see and feel\nthe touch (as a vibrotactile stimulus to the upper arm), and\nin the other would only see the touch. The authors found\nthat all participants were willing to sing at the request\nof the confederate, irrespective of the touch feedback they\nreceived, and suggest that the request was too easy for\nthe physical touch sensation to have any effect. It could\nalso be argued that the visual representation of the touch\nin\ufb02uenced compliance behavior to some extent (see also [45]\non response similarities between observed and experienced\ntouch).\n4.3.2 Communicating affect through mediated social touch\nIn actual human-human social touch, affect and discrete\nemotions can be communicated through different types of\ntouch [41]. Inspired by this, researchers have investigated\nthe extent to which mediated social touch can be used for the\ncommunication of affect and emotions. Bailenson et al. [169]\nfound that participants were able to use a force feedback\njoystick to differentially express a number of discrete emo-\ntions, using the joystick as if they were shaking someone\u2019s\nhand. When these expressions were played back to another\ngroup of participants using the same force feedback joystick,\nrecognition rates of all emotions were found to be above\nchance level.\nSuccessfully communicating affect through mediated so-\ncial touch, may depend on the relationship between the\ncommunication partners. In a study where participants\nused a haptic turning knob to express four emotions (i.e.\nrelaxed, delighted, angry, and unhappy) in either a Pong-\nlike game, or more intimate hand stroking scenario, it was\nfound that all emotions were recognized above chance level\n[170]. However, recognition rates were highest in the hand\nstroking scenario when the dyad of participants consisted of\na couple in a romantic relationship.\nThe extent to which emotions can be communicated may\nalso depend on the type of haptic feedback used, and the\ninput used to deliver it. In a study that employed a device\nthat could translate \ufb01nger touch gestures, and squeeze ges-\ntures to vibrotactile feedback, it was found that vibrotacitle\nfeedback could be used to communicate affective valence\nand arousal [171]. Squeeze gestures were found to be\nmore suitable for the communication of low valence, high\narousal states, while the \ufb01nger touch gesture was found to\nbe preferable for the communication of high valence, low\narousal states. When this was taken into account recognition\nof valence and arousal was well above chance level.

In\nanother study, participants expressed a number of discreteemotions using a touch-sensitive sleeve worn on the forearm\n[172]. Participants could play back the encoded emotion to\nthemselves, and adjust their expression. No clear differences\nin the way participants expressed the emotions was found\nfrom sensor data, possibly due to technical limitations of\nthe sleeve. However, participants did described their tactile\nexpressions of emotions in a way similar to emotional\nexpressions through actual social touch [41].\nFinally, the body location to which a mediated social\ntouch is applied could in\ufb02uence the affective experience of\nsuch a touch. Haans et al. [173] conducted a study in which\nparticipants used a chat program and were made to believe\nthey received vibrotactile mediated social touch from a male\nor female, to their abdomen, lower back, upper back, upper\narm, and wrist [173]. Gender was found to have no effect\non the pleasantness of the touches. However, touches to the\nstomach, arm and wrist were found to be less pleasant than\nthose on the back, while touches to the stomach were found\nto be even less pleasant than those on the arm.\n4.3.3 Affective responses to mediated social touch\nSocial touch can alter the way affective stimuli are pro-\ncessed, and can alter a person\u2019s affective state (e.g. [61]).\nResearch has been conducted to investigate whether medi-\nated social touch can have similar effects.\nSchirmer et al. [174] found that both actual human-\nhuman touch from a friend, mediated social touch (force\napplied by a pneumatic squeeze arm band) attributed to a\nfriend, or the same haptic stimulus attributed to a computer\nprogram, enhanced discrimination between neutral and\nnegative images. The authors suggest that touch, regardless\nof its source, sensitizes ongoing cognitive and emotional\nprocesses. Contrary results were obtained by Ellingsen et al.\n[162] who found that, after participants were administered\noxytocin, only actual human stroking touch on the forearm,\nand not vibrotactile stimulation on the hand, enhanced\nprocessing of images of emotional facial expressions. It is\npossible that differences in the types of haptic stimuli used,\nand the body location to which they were applied, account\nfor these different \ufb01ndings [162][174].\nSumioka et al. [175] found evidence that simple physical\ncontact can alter a person\u2019s affective state. It was found\nthat having a conversation using a huggable communication\ndevice [176] lowered cortisol levels (an indicator of stress) in\nelderly participants. A possible explanation for this \ufb01nding\nis that participants attribute the hugging of the pillow to\nthe person on the phone [175], thus in essence receiving a\npassive form of mediated social touch.\nCabibihan et al.

Several studies have investigated how medi-\nated social touch, compared to visual and auditory feedback\nonly, can enhance feelings of presence in number of different\nscenarios not necessarily directly related to actual human-\nhuman social touch interactions.\nOne \ufb01nding that is supported by a number of studies is\nthat haptic force feedback in a collaborative shared virtual\nenvironment (SVE) can positively affect feelings of presence.\nIt has been found that haptic feedback while collaborating\nin a SVE, whether this haptic feedback is task-related or\nnot [178], can enhance feelings of social presence [179],\ntask performance and sense of togetherness [180], with the\nlatter effect being stronger for female participants [180]. The\nattribution of the haptic feedback to another person (i.e. the\nmediated social touch aspect), in stead of general feedback\nfrom the SVE, is likely an important aspect in enhancing\nfeelings of social presence [149].\nImportantly, like for actual social touch, the framing of\nthe haptic feedback from another person can affect how this\ntype of mediated social touch is perceived. Brave et al.[181]\nfound that in a maze-navigation task in which participants\nwere made to believe they were either helped or deceived by\na remote partner, force feedback from the parter in the de-\nceiving condition led to participants feeling a stronger sense\nof control, and feeling more positive about the interaction\nand their interaction partner, than in the helping condition.\nMoreover, presence in SVE\u2019s, but also in other forms of\nmediated communication, can be in\ufb02uenced by congruent\nvisuo-haptic feedback in mediated social touch settings\n[144]. Haans and Ijsselsteijn [115] investigated how partic-\nipants responded to receiving vibrotactile mediated social\ntouch on different parts of their body, while receiving vi-\nsual feedback of the touches on a screen that depicted the\ntouches applied by another person to either a touch screen\nor to a mannequin body. For the mannequin condition,\nparticipants reported stronger feelings of telepresence, and\nelectrodermal activity indicated a higher level of physiolog-\nically arousal when participants saw the mannequin being\ntouched [115].\nThe previously discussed work involved systems that\ncombined visual, or audio-visual, and haptic feedback to\nenhance feelings of presence. Wang et al. [116] conducted a\nstudy where participants listened to a story, and, through\na squeeze band, received haptic feedback from the story-\nteller at emotional moments in the story. Participants who\nattributed the haptic feedback to the storyteller, felt closer to\nthe storyteller, than participants who attributed the haptic\nfeedback to the storyteller\u2019s autonomic arousal.

However,\nanother study that used the same story, touch moments,\nand haptic feedback, with the addition of a random touchcondition, found no effects of the storyteller\u2019s touches on\nsocial presence [182].\n5 S IMULATED SOCIAL TOUCH\nThe previous section outlined work on social touch me-\ndiated through haptic feedback technology. In most cases\ncommunication took place between dyads of participants,\nor occurred with participants being led to believe that they\nwere communicating with another person. The Media Equa-\ntion theory states that humans interact with a perceived\nintelligent system as if the system is a human social actor\n[183]. Research into embodied conversational agents and so-\ncial robots extends this idea by giving arti\ufb01cial social agents\na virtual or physical embodiment that can be used during\ninteraction with a user, for example to express emotions\n[184][185]. Following this line of reasoning, touches applied\nby a virtually or physically embodied arti\ufb01cial agent, could\nbe perceived by the user as social touches. Effects of actual\nhuman-human social touch might also occur in settings\nwhere the social touches are generated by a system.\nFor a social robot, the relation between social touches\nand its embodiment is direct, as it can use its physical\nbody to apply and receive touches. For a virtually embodied\narti\ufb01cial agent the relation between an applied or received\ntouch and the agent\u2019s embodiment is less direct. We argue\nhere that for a social touch applied by, or to, an arti\ufb01cial\nsocial agent to be considered as such, a relation between\nthe haptic sensation felt by the user, while either applying\nor receiving a social touch, and the agent\u2019s embodiment is\nnecessary. Here, multi-modal feedback is crucial. A user\nwill need to be able to identify the virtual agent as the\nsource of the felt touch sensation. Congruent visuo-haptic\nfeedback [115][186], where the sensation felt by the user\nis synchronized to the visual feedback from the agent\u2019s\nembodiment, would be essential to create the illusion that\nsocial touch occurs between a virtually embodied agent and\na user [24].\nThe focus in this section is on intentional touch simu-\nlated by human-like arti\ufb01cial social agents. Though tactile\ninteractions with animal-like robots are also found in the\nliterature, the type of haptic feedback these robots produce\nis mainly aimed at simulating animal behavior [187][188],\nand thus differs considerably in its intentionality from\npurposefully applied social touches. Moreover, there are\nclear differences in expectations and accepted social norms\nbetween zoomorphic and humanoid robots [189], that may\nbecome especially relevant when simulated social touch is\nconcerned [190].\nIn this section we will discuss literature on simulated\nsocial touch according to a number of common topics that\nappear in the literature. Virtual agents and social robots\nwill be discussed separately, based on differences in their\nembodiment and the use of touch in interactions with them\n[190].\n5.1 Touching virtual agents\nTwo distinct advantages of adding touch capabilities to", "doc_id": "98657832-c8d0-42e7-91f8-3090c73ef693", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4ab21cc30c0522f35ba6bb35e46b585801087fa1abdbc653ffb80ec2f3bd9683", "extra_info": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3109, "end": 6922}, "relationships": {"1": "2b2688f1-b716-4845-96f0-6ea8f2ec9db2", "2": "73621634-b63c-48ca-9001-7d51e47fd851", "3": "3113d959-8677-4f7b-86b6-09b1c54b60d5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3113d959-8677-4f7b-86b6-09b1c54b60d5": {"__data__": {"text": "also found in the\nliterature, the type of haptic feedback these robots produce\nis mainly aimed at simulating animal behavior [187][188],\nand thus differs considerably in its intentionality from\npurposefully applied social touches.

Second, the virtual\nnature of the agent as well as the (virtual) environment in\nwhich the agent resides, offer unique opportunities for the\ncontrolled study of social touch. Being able to control both\nthe behaviors of the agent as well as the situation in which\nthe interaction between the agent and a user takes place,\nallows for interesting experimental paradigms for social\ntouch. The use of augmented reality (AR) or VR technology\ncould be especially fruitful here.\nAn important challenge in adding touch capabilities to\nvirtual agents is that their virtual embodiment does not\ndirectly afford touch interaction. Therefore designers and re-\nsearchers have had to \ufb01nd ways for allowing virtual agents\nto \u2018reach out of the screen\u2019 and touch the user. This could\ninvolve having users wear actuators, such as vibrotactile\nactuators, on their body that can be activated in synchrony\nwith a predetermined agent behavior [24]. In situations\nwhere the user applies a touch to the agent, the challenge is\nto let users \u2018reach into the screen\u2019 in order to apply a touch.\nOne approach involves the use of a force feedback joystick\nthat controls a pointer in the virtual space [191]. Virtual\nobjects encountered by this pointer, such as touching an\nagent\u2019s torso, can be rendered haptically using the joystick,\nthus providing the user with a sense of touch. Bidirectional\ntouch between virtual agents and users could be achieved\nby combining both approaches or by using passive haptic\nfeedback to allow users to touch the agent, for example\nthrough the use of a mannequin [192]. We will provide an\noverview of designs and studies that use these techniques\nto introduce simulated social touch in interactions between\nvirtual agents and humans.\n5.1.1 Touch to enhance emotional expressivity of virtual\nagents\nA major direction in virtual agent research is the expression\nof emotions through facial expressions [184]. Potentially, the\naddition of touch capabilities could enhance the emotional\nexpressivity of virtual agents. Bonnet et al. [193] found that\nthe recognition of certain emotional facial expressions made\nby a virtual agent was enhanced by adding congruent haptic\nexpressions of emotions, using a force feedback joystick.\nConversely, for some emotional expressions, haptic feed-\nback deteriorated recognition, possibly due to confusions\nin the haptic expression of certain emotions (e.g. sadness,\nsurprise). Gaffary et al. [194] set out to investigate how\nhaptic emotional expressions, expressed through a force\nfeedback joystick, can enhance the recognition of visually\nmore ambiguous emotions expressed by a virtual agent.\nWhile pure visual expressions were better recognized than\npure haptic expressions, visuo-haptic expressions were bet-\nter recognized than either visual or haptic expressions alone.\nThe authors conclude that high valence emotions are better\nexpressed visually, while high arousal emotions are better\nexpressed haptically.\nIt has to be noted here that in the studies of Bonnet et\nal. [193] and Gaffary et al. [194] there was no clear relation\nbetween the embodiment of the agent and the haptically\nexpressed emotions.

An interesting avenue for future re-\nsearch would be to conduct similar studies with congruentvisuo-haptic feedback, where the agent uses its embodiment\nto express each emotion through touch. A \ufb01rst step in this\ndirection was taken by Bickmore et al. [195] who designed\na virtual agent that was partially physically embodied. The\nvirtual agent\u2019s face was displayed on a computer monitor\nsituated on top of a mannequin body. One of the hands of\nthe mannequin was equipped with an air bladder that could\nbe in\ufb02ated, producing a squeezing sensation in the hand of\na user holding the agent\u2019s hand. It was found that, using\nonly touch, squeeze intensity and frequency could be used\nto communicate emotional valence and arousal. However in\ncombination with visual and auditory modalities, touch had\nlittle effect [195]. Finally it was found that positive effects of\nthe agent\u2019s touch were mainly found for participants who\nwere more comfortable with social touch in general [195].\n5.1.2 Touching virtual agents for training\nSocial touch can be used instrumentally, in a task-related\nfashion [11], especially in medical, or therapeutic settings\n[15]. Because training staff to become pro\ufb01cient in such\nuses of touch can be dif\ufb01cult and time-consuming, this\nis where virtual agents can be useful. Kotranza and Lok\n[192][196] designed a virtual agent that is visible in VR\nthrough a head mounted display, and that has a mannequin-\nlike physical embodiment which the user can touch. The\nauthors propose that this type of \u201cmixed reality human\u201d\ncan be used in training scenarios for breast examinations.\nThe physical embodiment of the agent provides passive\nhaptic feedback, whereas areas of the body relevant to the\nscenario (i.e. clothing and the breast) contain sensors to\ndetect touches. The virtual representation of the agent can\nrespond to touches detected through the sensors, by using\nspeech, gestures and facial expressions. It was found that\nmedical students experienced a greater feeling of presence,\nand employed touches similar to those used in a real breast\nexamination [192]. In a comparison with a training using an\nactor, it was found that medical students rated both expe-\nriences similar on believability and perceived educational\nbene\ufb01ts, and spent an equal amount of time palpating the\nbreast [196]. Kotranza et al. [197] enhanced the mixed reality\npatient with the ability to visually or visuo-haptically, using\nservo-motors to move the mannequin\u2019s arm, touch the user,\nas well as respond to user\u2019s touches. Studies showed that\nmedical students used touches to communicate empathy,\nconcern, comfort, and to gain the virtual patient\u2019s compli-\nance. Furthermore, it was found that viso-haptic touch from\nthe virtual patient successfully communicated the virtual\npatient\u2019s fear, and made it seem more human-like [197].\n5.1.3 Touching virtual agents as social actors\nAdding social touch capabilities to a virtual agent expands\nthe communicative repertoire of the agent, and could make\nit a more complete social actor.

In\na pilot study, the authors failed to \ufb01nd an effect of the\nagent\u2019s touch on increasing compliance to a request made\nby the agent, potentially due to large individual differences\nin participant\u2019s trait compliance [24].\nHuisman et al. [198][199] conducted a study in which\ntwo virtual agents, visible through a hand-held tablet in\nAR, interacted with a user in a collaborative or competitive\ngame scenario. Participants wore a vibrotactile display on\nboth their upper arms and on their abdomen (for general\nfeedback during the game). Once prior to playing the game,\nand twice after playing the game, one of the agents would\napply a touch to the right or left upper arm of the partici-\npant. Touches were visible through the tablet\u2019s screen and\ncould be felt by the participant through the appropriate vi-\nbrotactile display. In both the collaborative and competitive\ncondition the touching virtual agent was rated higher on\ninterpersonal warmth, than the non-touching agent. This\neffect was more pronounced for participants who were more\ncomfortable with social touch in general [199].\nBailenson and Yee [191] conducted a study in which\nparticipants, wearing a VR headset and using a force feed-\nback joystick, were tasked with brushing virtual dirt off\nof male and female virtual agents, and virtual geometric\nshapes. Participants touched virtual humans with less force\nthan virtual objects, touched the face of virtual agents with\nless force than the torso, and touched male virtual agents\nwith more force than female virtual agents. As the au-\nthors suggest, haptic differentiation between touching vir-\ntual agents and virtual objects, and between body location\nand gender, points to an enhanced sense of co-presence,\nwhere participants treat the virtual agents more like social\nactors [191]. Moreover, the visual appearance of the virtual\nagent may in\ufb02uence touching behavior. Tremblay et al. [200]\nfound that participants, using two haptic devices, hugged\nvirtual agents differently depending on their gender and\nbody size. Male participants hugged normal weight female\nvirtual agents longer than overweight female agents, while\nfemale participants hugged normal weight male virtual\nagents longer than overweight male agents.\n5.2 Touching social robots: Tactile HRI\nPhysically embodied arti\ufb01cial social agents offer the most\ndirect means for social touch interactions between humans\nand arti\ufb01cial social agents. The \ufb01eld of tactile human robot\ninteraction (Tactile HRI) is concerned with two themes in\nthe research \ufb01eld of robotics, namely: tactile detection, and\nHRI [201]. Detection often occurs through, soft- or hard shell\nskin-type sensors, or through sensors in the robot\u2019s joints\n[201]. For example, Yoshikai et al.

The sensors can detect 3D force distributions,\nallowing the robot to respond to physical interactions such\nas being picked up, and hugged.

HRI that involves physical\ninteractions between the robot and a human, can be studied\nfrom the perspective of safety (e.g. accidental contact) or\nfrom the perspective of behavior- development and exe-\ncution by the robot [201]. Here we are interested in thelatter and will focus on what potential effects touching or\nbeing touched by a social robot might have on the human\ninteraction partner.\n5.2.1 Tactile HRI and care\nSocial robots have a wide range of potential applications in\nhealth care settings [204], For example, children with autism\nspectrum disorder (ASD) could bene\ufb01t from interactions\nwith social robots [205]. In such care-related HRI applica-\ntions, simulated social touch could play an important role.\nRobins et al. [206] propose that tactile interaction with\nsocial robots can help children with ASD, who often suffer\nfrom hypertactility [207], to get accustomed to social touch,\npotentially making them more comfortable being touched\nby a real person. To this purpose Robins et al. [206][208] had\nchildren with ASD physically interact with a social robot in a\nfree play session, and found that the children used different\ntouch behaviors to engage with the robot [206][208]. In a\nfollow-up study, Robins et al. [209] studied the interaction\nbetween children with ASD and a social robot that could\nrespond to touch in a playful cause-and-effect game. The\nrobot responded positively to light touch and negatively\nto harsh touch, by vocal utterances, facial expressions, and\nbody movement. After repeated interactions with guidance\nfrom the experimenter, children were able to develop a non-\naggressive touch interaction style with the robot. Addition-\nally, an approach where the robot gives appropriate multi-\nmodal feedback to being touched, can have positive effects\non the body awareness of children with ASD [210].\nIn a scenario where an abstract humanoid-robot acted\nas a nurse, and participants acted as patients, Chen et al.\n[211][212] had the robot apply a stroking touch to the par-\nticipant\u2019s lower arm. The meaning of the touch was framed\nas either instrumental (i.e. cleaning) or affective (i.e. com-\nforting), and was either preceded by a verbal warning from\nthe robot, or not. Participants rated the instrumental touch\nas more necessary than the affective touch, and experienced\nlower emotional arousal and higher emotional valence for\nthe instrumental touch compared to the affective touch. It is\npossible that the use of a social robot with a more friendly\nappearance could have altered the results [212]. Neverthe-\nless, these \ufb01ndings show that the perceived intent of the\nreceived tactile sensation in\ufb02uences participants\u2019 perception\nof simulated social touch.\n5.2.2 Tactile HRI for attitude and behavior change\nSocial touch simulated by a social robot could be used to\npositively in\ufb02uence the user\u2019s attitude towards the robot,\npotentially leading to the user adopting more favorable\nbehavior towards the robot as well.", "doc_id": "d31be6c8-5062-42fa-925a-e57216dc18be", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fcb3cbd88dd5d79fdfd200deea41c53bedee3b4cac8af35f7e43ef4e2f53fc3f", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3173, "end": 6754}, "relationships": {"1": "2f7193e2-5954-4fe2-90a1-091a5f99260c", "2": "33dc8483-3a91-444a-bc14-88395b8178b2", "3": "e6c86699-64e3-4146-b7b7-f64e44f4c837"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6c86699-64e3-4146-b7b7-f64e44f4c837": {"__data__": {"text": "rated the instrumental touch\nas more necessary than the affective touch, and experienced\nlower emotional arousal and higher emotional valence for\nthe instrumental touch compared to the affective touch.

Furthermore, the absence of social touch by\nthe robot resulted in participants with a positive attitude\ntowards robots, to rate it as more machine-like.\nNie et al. [215] found that actual physical contact with a\nsocial robot in the form of holding the robot\u2019s warm hand,\nresulted in participants perceiving the robot as signi\ufb01cantly\nmore friendly, trustworthy and human-like, while watching\na horror movie. However, warm touch could not attenuate\nthe scare effects of the horror movie.\nSome studies have found indications that simulated so-\ncial touch by social robots can elicit the Midas touch effect\n[13].

Behavioral\nevidence for the robotic Midas touch effect was found by\nNakagawa et al. [217]. After a stroking touch to the hand\nby a small humanoid robot, participants spent signi\ufb01cantly\nmore time on a repetitive task, completed more actions\nduring the task, and rated the robot higher on friendliness,\ncompared to no touch, or passive touch (handholding). Note\nthat, using a similar experimental setup, Huisman et al. [24]\ndid not \ufb01nd any such effects on compliance for touch by a\nvirtual agent.\n6 C ONCLUSIONS\nIn this survey an overview of research from diverse \ufb01elds,\nincluding neuroscience and social psychology, that deal\nwith the human sense of touch in social interactions, was\npresented. Work on actual social touch has inspired re-\nsearchers to investigate the use of haptic technology for\nsocial touch. In the current survey these efforts were brought\ntogether under the title social touch technology (STT). Re-\nsearch into STT is beginning to move beyond explorations\n(see [8][112]). It is using more formal methods such as val-\nidated questionnaires (e.g. [218]) and psychophysiological\nmeasures, and is starting to shed light on factors underlying\nSTT. The continuing effort to improve on the methods used\nis especially important for STT when comparisons are made\nwith actual social touch.\nSimilar to results obtained for actual social touch, STT re-\nsearch has found a Midas touch effect in mediated [103][167]\nand simulated [216][217] social touch. Indications that the\nMidas touch effect in general is partially explained by a\nconfederate bias have also been found [103]. Future research\nshould capitalize on the use of AR/VR technology and\nsocial robots to investigate the Midas touch effect and the\npotential confederate bias in more detail.\nAs for actual social touch, mediated social touch has\nbeen found to be suitable for the communication of\nemotions, but successful communication of emotions", "doc_id": "dfc464d5-eedd-4225-8acf-ec5dbe3b1cf2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b2b58ffe64b172f543ad5698804ecb113f1c977fef483722d3548441cbe46759", "extra_info": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3727}, "relationships": {"1": "eeac2502-081f-4e0d-a78e-a7cb164e221b", "3": "4789aba1-500c-4599-be54-c045a3364cca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4789aba1-500c-4599-be54-c045a3364cca": {"__data__": {"text": "and psychophysiological\nmeasures, and is starting to shed light on factors underlying\nSTT.

Future research\nshould capitalize on the use of AR/VR technology and\nsocial robots to investigate the Midas touch effect and the\npotential confederate bias in more detail.\nAs for actual social touch, mediated social touch has\nbeen found to be suitable for the communication of\nemotions, but successful communication of emotions de-\npends on the methods of touch input and output used[169][172][195]. Current research indicates that force feed-\nback devices are more successful in this regard [169]. It\nshould also be noted that studies were conducted in lab\nsettings and that the expression of emotions through touch\nmay depend on contextual factors [170][173], thus future\nresearch in this direction should ideally include clear contex-\ntualizations to further investigate the expression of emotions\nthrough STT.\nWhile for actual social touch there is evidence of stress\nreducing effects, the \ufb01ndings for STT on physiological re-\nsponses is largely inconclusive, likely due to differences\nin the way touches were applied and measurements were\ntaken [141][177]. It would be worthwhile to further inves-\ntigate how speci\ufb01c types of haptic feedback could produce\ncertain physiological responses, for example with the aim of\nreducing stress.\nThe most robust \ufb01nding regarding STT is that it en-\nhances social presence in shared virtual environments\n[115][149][179], and makes arti\ufb01cial social actors seem more\nhuman-like [197][199]. It is plausible that a suf\ufb01cient level\nof social presence is necessary for a person to experience a\ncertain type of haptic stimulation as social touch [8]. Thus\nSTT in relation to presence research remains a promising\narea of future research.\nAn important recommendation that can be made for\nfuture STT research in general is to investigate structurally,\nthe interplay of top-down (i.e. attribution) and bottom-up\nprocesses (i.e.. somatosensory processing of haptic stimuli).\nUnder which circumstances is it necessary to provide a\nmore realistic, human touch-like form of haptic stimula-\ntion, and when does vibrotactile stimulation suf\ufb01ce in STT?\nThe availability of additional multimodal cues should be\nconsidered in such a question, not just for providing infor-\nmation about the touch and toucher, such as their gender\n[44], but also for providing information about the broader\ncontext in which the touch takes place, for example a com-\npetitive/collaborative game scenario [199] or a calming or\ninstrumental touch [212].\nThe observed effects of STT occur despite the fact that\nthe haptic stimuli used in STT, such as vibrotactile or force\nfeedback, offer only part of the physical composition of an\nactual human touch (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2). It would\ntherefore seem that the effects of STT occur not because the\nhaptic feedback feels particularly like a human touch, but\nbecause the haptic feedback is attributed to either another\nperson in a remote location, or to an arti\ufb01cial social actor\nsuch as a virtual agent. As was discussed in Section 4 it is\nimportant to ensure that the recipient of a touch is aware of\nthe fact that the felt haptic sensation originates from another\nsocial actor.

Section 4.2\nshows that designers and researchers have explored diverse\nactuation methods, indicating at least an intuitive drive\nfor exploring the in\ufb02uence of the qualities of the haptic\nsensation in STT. Moreover, there is evidence that at least\npart of the effects of STT may also occur in a bottom-up fash-\nion [174]. Furthermore, it is plausible that certain types of\nhaptic stimuli are more suitable for social touch interactions\nthan others, such as in the communication of affect [171],\nand for stress reducing responses [141][177]. It is plausible\nthat the use of warmth, and its relation to interpersonal\nwarmth [219], may be an important factor in stress reduction\nthrough STT. Investigating which types of haptic stimuli\nare more suitable in speci\ufb01c settings is an interesting area\nof future STT research. Research could capitalize on recent\ndiscoveries in neuroscience and investigate stimulation of\nCT afferents and addressing the affective touch system, to\ninvestigate potential bottom-up effects (Section 2.2).\nIn Section 4.3 we discussed that following paradigms\nfrom social touch research is one way to demonstrate re-\nsponse similarities between social touch through haptic\ntechnology and actual social touch. Further evidence for\nsuch parallels is important as a foundation for STT. On the\nother hand, such a foundation may also be important for\nthe continued research into actual social touch. If effects of\nSTT show parallels to actual social touch, it may be possible\nto employ STT as a research tool for actual social touch.\nHere we want to draw attention to three ways in which STT\ncould help social touch research. First, STT can offer control\nof the sensory qualities of the haptic stimulus. Haptic in-\nterfaces allow for minute control over sensory qualities of a\nhaptic stimulus, much more so than actual human touch.\nUsing haptic technology, the timing of touches, the type\nof feedback produced (e.g. vibrotactile, warmth), and the\nexact body location to which it is applied, can be controlled.\nThis would allow for studies into the role of individual\nsubmodalities of touch, such as vibration and force, in social\ntouch interactions. The study of CT optimal touch already\nbene\ufb01ts from the use of haptic interfaces to enable exact\ncontrol of the stroking touches\u2019 velocity and force [36][37].\nSecond, STT can help social touch research by offering\ncontrol over contextual factors through the use of multi-\nmodal feedback, most potently through VR/AR. Using such\ntechnology, information from other modalities (e.g. visual,\nauditory) that can strongly in\ufb02uence the interpretation of\na touch, can be controlled. Having control over such factors\nmay be especially valuable for disentangling effects of touch\nfrom those of other modalities. An example of using STT in\nsuch a way is found in work on the Midas Touch,", "doc_id": "2cca3593-4494-49c1-a22c-1754a332d745", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "16d36523dc1329049bb47d8f38b4b2dc71f8be8ad7a5144110b94ab86d1c2a41", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Huisman2017SocialTouchTechnologyASurveyofHapticTechnologyforSocialTouch.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3788}, "relationships": {"1": "a4920619-75fd-40f8-9a8d-ae3b0b950368", "3": "cbfeec42-edb0-470f-ac15-1c713c45d9a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbfeec42-edb0-470f-ac15-1c713c45d9a7": {"__data__": {"text": "of touch, such as vibration and force, in social\ntouch interactions.

An example of using STT in\nsuch a way is found in work on the Midas Touch, for which,\nusing mediated social touch, a confederate bias was found,\nwhich could not have been uncovered using actual social\ntouch [103].\nFinally, STT can offer social touch research accurate\nmeasurement techniques, and the possibility of automaticclassi\ufb01cation of touches [119] afforded by sensor technology\nand machine learning. The use of such techniques is a good\nway of obtaining behavioral data related to social touch,\nthat in regular social touch interactions is dif\ufb01cult to obtain.\nIn turn, gathering such behavioral data could also prove\ninvaluable for the generation of social touches by arti\ufb01cial\nsocial agents, such as social robots.\nThis interaction between social touch research and STT\nresearch is important when the applications of STT are con-\nsidered. For example, arti\ufb01cial social agents, as discussed\nin Section 5, have a need to detect and understand touch\nbehavior of human communication partners for the gen-\neration of appropriate responses. The use of social touch\nmight actually be necessary for the forming of a bond, and\nto match expectations of social robots [190], whose physical\nembodiment affords touch. It is to be expected that as social\nrobots become more prevalent in areas such as education\nand healthcare, such social touch interactions become more\nimportant, especially considering the effects of actual social\ntouch for wellbeing, the communication of affect, and the\nforming of social relationships as discussed in Section 3.\nWhat is more, advances in VR and AR technology, not\nto mention the current popularity of these technologies,\nenables new ways to interact with virtual characters, and\nremotely located people. Haptic technology used in VR and\nAR is also becoming increasingly unobtrusive and provides\never more realistic sensations (a good examples is HTC\nVive\u2019s \u2019bow and arrow demo\u2019). With such technologies\nbecoming more commonplace as methods for social com-\nmunication, as attested to by interest from social media\ncompanies such as Facebook, it is to be expected that this\ntechnology will ultimately feature social interactions in com-\nbination with haptic technology. Thus STT may play a role\nin future applications for gaming and entertainment, and\nremote interpersonal communication.\nFinally, it is not unthinkable that, provided further evi-\ndence for similarities between actual social touch and STT\nis found, that STT, in combinations with the discussed\nenabling technologies and applications, could provide social\ntouch in situations where actual social touch is currently\nfound to be lacking. For example in elderly care where the\nnumber of contact hours is limited [15]. Future research, and\napplications that \ufb02ow from this research may thus enable\nSTT to extend the reach of social touch.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis publication is supported by the Dutch national pro-\ngram COMMIT.\nREFERENCES\n[1] V .

He highlightedthe various affordances of touch: (a) the ability ofthe skin to make temporal and spatial discrimi-nations that rival those achieved by our eyes andears; (b) the effectiveness of cutaneous sensa-tions for capturing attention; (c) the large area forpotential stimulation of the skin (approximately1.8\u20132.0 m\n2in area in the average adult; Montagu,\n1971), and (d) the underutilization of this channelfor presenting information.\nGeldard (1957) designed the \ufb01rst tactile lan-\nguage, Vibratese. It consisted of 45 basic elementsthat varied along three dimensions: amplitude, du-ration, and location. Vibratese was initially testedon three individuals who were able to learn thelanguage in only 12 hr and reached a plateau at areceiving rate of 38 words per minute.Although Vibratese has since vanished, re-\nsearch and development in the area of tactile infor-mation presentation has continued and, in recent\nyears, experienced a surge that is driven by bothneed and opportunity: the need to present increas-ing amounts of complex data to users in workdomains that face problems with visual and audi-tory data overload and the need to support immer-sion and embeddedness in virtual environments.The opportunity to utilize the sense of touch forthese purposes emerged as a result of tactile dis-play technologies becoming more sophisticated,less intrusive, and thus more effective and accept-able to users.\nThe sense of touch is not only a promising but\nalso a unique communication channel. In contrastto vision and hearing, the two senses traditionallyemployed in the design of user interfaces, it alsorepresents a proximal sense \u2013 that is, it senses ob-jects that are in contact with the body \u2013 and it is bi-directional in that it supports both perception andTactile Displays: Guidance for Their Design and Application\nLynette A.

Its goal is to assist hu-\nman factors practitioners in deciding when and how to employ the sense of touch forthe purpose of information representation. The article also identi\ufb01es important researchneeds in this area. Background: First attempts to utilize the sense of touch as a medi-\num for communication date back to the late 1950s. For the next 35 years progress inthis area was relatively slow, but recent years have seen a surge in the interest and devel-opment of tactile displays and the integration of tactile signals in multimodal interfaces.Athorough understanding of the properties of this sensory channel and its interaction\nwith other modalities is needed to ensure the effective and robust use of tactile displays.Methods: First, an overview of vibrotactile perception is provided.

In addition, the proximal nature of touch al-lows for the creation of private displays. This is animportant affordance when information is con\ufb01-dential or privileged (e.g., in military contexts) andin environments that suffer from auditory clutter.In the latter situation, some information may berelevant for one or only a few people (e.g., alarmsand noti\ufb01cations in an operating room).\nThe focus of this review is on tactile displays\nthat provide vibrotactile or static tactile inputs tothe user to assist in the performance of a task. Inthe context of display technologies, interfaces thatpresent both the tactile and kinesthetic cues asso-ciated with active movements are called hapticdisplays and typically present the forces associat-ed with contact to users. The forces are activelyproduced by the device and are of suf\ufb01cient mag-nitude that they can resist the movements of theuser\u2019s hand and arm. In any application, the choicebetween a haptic or tactile interface depends, toa large extent, on the nature of the task that needsto be supported.\nTactile displays take many different forms and\nare developed for a variety of purposes, includingspatial orientation and guidance, noti\ufb01cations andalerts, feedback on the success of control actionsin human-computer interaction, and sensory sub-stitution. They are employed in a number of ap-plication domains in which other communicationchannels, such as vision and audition, are heavilytaxed already or in which visual displays are in-convenient or less appropriate. Examples of suchdomains include car cockpits, surgical instruments,and navigation aids in military operations. Tactilesignals are also increasingly included in the de-sign of multimodal interfaces, where they com-plement visual and auditory feedback.\nThe goal of the present paper is to assist de-\nsigners in deciding when and how to employ thesense of touch to present information. It focuseson vibrotactile displays and their applications anddoes not cover haptic or thermal display technol-ogy. It provides an overview of vibrotactile per-ception and of the processes underlying tactile and\nmultimodal information processing. Next, tactiledisplay technologies are reviewed. Various appli-cations of tactile displays are discussed, and the role\nof touch in the context of multimodal information\npresentation is examined.

Five main types of mechanoreceptorshave been identi\ufb01ed in hairy skin, two of whichare slowly adapting and three that are rapidlyadapting. An understanding of the functional char-acteristics of these mechanoreceptors is essential\nto the development of effective tactile displays.This section will primarily focus on vibrotactilesensation in hairy skin, as most of the tactile dis-plays considered in this review are mounted oneither the torso or the arms. However, informationregarding tactile sensation in the glabrous skin onthe hand will be discussed as appropriate.\nFrequency of Vibrotactile Stimulation\nThe function that describes the relation between\nthe amplitude required to detect vibration and thefrequency of stimulation represents the upperbounds of sensory resolution on the skin and isused as the basis for specifying the stimulationcharacteristics (e .g., vibration frequency", "doc_id": "745ce29c-d0b5-4ea2-bf96-56a4d6a108d2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "62fcf95a858949240a21f2810938237af627c831644dbfdd95f76a26bb5335a2", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Jones_JoHFaE_2008.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3884}, "relationships": {"1": "e360e5dd-4882-4b52-a0b8-149821b7eca6", "3": "26aaa8a5-f7d5-4604-9a5a-b381a01b561f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "26aaa8a5-f7d5-4604-9a5a-b381a01b561f": {"__data__": {"text": "hairy skin, two of whichare slowly adapting and three that are rapidlyadapting.

This relation has been mea-sured at numerous sites on the body at frequencies\nranging from 0.4 to 1000 Hz (Bolanowski, Ge-scheider, & Verrillo, 1994; Gescheider, Bolan-owski, Pope, & Verrillo, 2002; Sherrick, 1953;Verrillo, 1963) and is shown in Figure 1 for the\n\ufb01ngertip, forearm, and abdomen, three regions ofthe body often used to display tactile cues.\nOptimal sensitivity is achieved at frequencies\nbetween 150 and 300 Hz for all sites, and at lowerand higher frequencies the displacement of theskin must be greater to be detected. The amplitudefor detecting vibration at any given frequency does,however, vary considerably over the body, with thelowest thresholds (i.e., highest sensitivity) beingmeasured on the \ufb01ngertips (0.07 \u00b5m at 200 Hz)\nand the highest thresholds in the abdominal andgluteal regions (4\u201314 \u00b5m at 200 Hz; Wilska,\n1954).

Asthe amplitude of vibration increases (at a constantfrequency), the perceived frequency of the signal(i.e., pitch) also increases, although the rate atwhich perceived frequency changes varies con-siderably across people (B\u00e9k\u00e9sy, 1959; Morley &Rowe, 1990).\nFurthermore, the relation between the perceived\nand actual frequency of vibrotactile stimulationvaries in different regions of the body, presumablybecause of variations in the innervation density ofmechanoreceptors and the damping effects of un-derlying soft tissue. In regions with high inner-vation densities, such as the \ufb01ngertips, perceivedfrequency increases more rapidly with increases infrequency than it does in areas with lower densi-ties,such as the arm (B\u00e9k\u00e9sy, 1962).\nMowbray and Gebhard (1957) used a handheld\nvibrating rod to measure the differential thresh-olds for frequencies ranging from 1 to 320 cyclesper second. They determined that the thresholdwas small at low frequencies (2%\u20134%), increasedslightly at higher frequencies (6%\u20138%), and aver-aged 4.6% across the range of frequencies tested.They did not attempt to control for pitch-frequencyinteractions and claimed that these interactions\ndid not affect their \ufb01ndings, particularly at low fre-quencies. Th eir values are, however, considerably\nsmaller than the differential thresholds measuredon the \ufb01nger pad by Goff (1967), who did controlfor changes in perceived intensity. She reportedthreshold values that varied from 18% to 50% forfrequencies ranging from 25 to 200 cycles persecond.\nIn two more recent studies (Mahns, Perkins,\nSahai, Robinson, & Rowe, 2006; Rothenberg, Ver-rillo, Zahorian, Brachman, & Bolanowski, 1977)in which frequency discrimination was measuredon the forearm and \ufb01ngertip using equal-sensationstimuli, the Weber fraction (differential thresholddivided by reference frequency expressed as a per-centage) was reported to change as a function of\nfrequency. Rothenberg et al. (1977) noted that itincreased from around 18% at 20 Hz to approxi-mately 30% at 300 Hz, whereas Mahns et al. (2006)reported that it decreased from 30% at 20 Hz to13% at 200 Hz. In the later study, the authors notedthere was no difference between the \ufb01ngertip andthe forearm in terms of the ability to discriminatevibrotactile stimuli.\nThese results, together with those from other\nstudies on vibrotactile frequency discrimination,are summarized in Figure 3.

From their results,Rothenberg et al. (1977) suggested that there mightbe at least seven potentially differentiable steps invibrotactile frequency on the forearm that couldbe used in a tactile display. Using an informationanalysis of data on the perceived rates of vibrationpresented to the \ufb01nger, Sherrick (1985) proposedthat only three to \ufb01ve rates can be distinguishedover the range of 2 to 300 pulses per second butthat when intensity is added as a redundant cue,the number of recognizable rates increases to \ufb01veto eight.\nIn the context of a tactile display that presents\ninformation to an operator engaged in a number oftasks, it is unclear whether vibration frequency isa useful parameter to vary, given the bandwidth ofthe tactile system and the complex interactionsbetween frequency and amplitude in vibrotactilefrequency discrimination. Several years ago Gel-dard (1960) cautioned that frequency \u201cwould haveto be handled gingerly in a [tactile] communicationsystem, especially if intensity were simultaneous-lymanipulated as a variable\u201d (p. 1586).\nDuration of Vibrotactile Stimulation\nAfurther variable that can be used to encode in-\nformation in a tactile display is temporal variationin the stimuli presented. Three temporal compo-nents to vibrotactile stimuli have been studied: theburst duration of the stimulus, the pulse repetitionrate, and the number of pulses. In most tactile dis-plays the duration of the stimulus ranges from 80to 500 ms, typically repeated in a sequence of on/off pulses. Not surprisingly, it has also been shownthat as the duration of a tactile stimulus increasesfrom 80 to 320 ms, the ability to identify a tactilepattern improves (Summers et al.,1997). When thetactile signal is functioning as a simple alert, peo-ple prefer that the duration of the tactile pulses bebetween 50 and 200 ms, as stimuli of longer dur-ations are perceived as annoying (Kaaresoja &Linjama, 2005).\nIt is also possible to group vibrotactile pulses of\nvarying durations together so as to create rhythmsthat encode information (e.g., urgency of message,proximity of vehicle). Brown, Brewster, and Pur-chase (2005) have shown that participants can\nidentify three different rhythms with an accuracyof 93%. In this study both the tactile rhythm andcomplexity of the waveform were independentlyvaried to create tactile patterns called tactons.\nThe capacity to perceive vibrotactile frequen-\ncy appears to be largely attributable to temporalcues rather than spectral properties, as the humantactile system seems to be relatively insensitiveto variations in waveform, in marked contrast tothe perception of timbre by the auditory system(Cholewiak et al., 2004; Summers et al., 1997).However, variations in waveform can be per-ceived if the complexity of a waveform is variedby using amplitude-modulated sinusoids, in whichthe amplitude of a base signal (e.g., 250 Hz) ismodulated by a second sinusoid (e.g., 30 Hz). Asthe modulating frequency changes, so too does theperceived \u201croughness\u201d of the resulting waveform.For a base signal of 250 Hz the roughness increas-esas the modulation frequency decreases from\n50 to 20 Hz (see Figure 7, later in this paper), so bymodulating a 250-Hz signal at different frequen-cies it is possible to create waveforms that vary in\u201croughness\u201d (Brown et al., 2005).

Thechange in intensity that is reliably discriminated(i.e., the difference threshold) depends on theamplitude of the vibration, but it does not followWeber\u2019s law.

This matching of\nsubjective magnitudes would be required if infor-\nmation in a display was being encoded in terms ofonly vibrotactile frequency, not in combinationwith any other encoding variable.\nThe absolute and differential thresholds for vi-\nbrotactile intensity can be used to determine howmuch stimulus intensity should be varied in a tac-tile display for an observer to detect a change. Inaddition, it is important to understand how supra-threshold stimuli are perceived so that the percep-tual effect of doubling or halving stimulus intensityis known. The psychophysical function that relatesthe amplitude of a vibrotactile stimulus to its per-ceived intensity has been measured in a numberof experiments (e.g., S. S. Stevens, 1968; Verrillo& Chamberlain, 1972; Verrillo et al., 1969).\nThe results from these studies indicate that the\nperceived intensity of vibration increases as a pow-erfunction of the physical intensity of the vibration\nwith an exponent ranging from 0.45 to 0.95, de-pending on the site tested (V errillo & Chamberlain,1972) and the frequency of vibration (S.S. Stevens,\n1968). The slope or exponent of this psychophysical\nfunction relating physical to perceived magnitudeis inversely related to the density of neural inner-vation at the skin site tested (see Figure 5), whichmeans that the perceived magnitude of vibrationincreases more rapidly as the sensitivity to vibra-tion decreases (Verrillo, 1973; Verrillo & Cham-\nberlain, 1972). In the context of a tactile display,this means that changes in vibrotactile intensityare perceived to be greater if they are presented toa site such as the torso or arm, rather than to the\ufb01ngers.\nIn all these studies on the perception of vibro-\ntactile intensity, the amplitude of a single vibrato-ry stimulus was varied. The perceived intensity ofvibrotactile stimulation can also be manipulatedby varying the number of vibrating motors (calledtactors) used to present the stimulus. Cholewiak(1979) mounted a tactile display on the thigh andfound that as the number of active tactors increasedfrom 1 to 64, there was a linear increase in the per-ceived intensity of the vibrotactile stimulation for\nfrequencies above 40 Hz. This suggests that theintensity of a vibrotactile stimulus on the body canbe varied by changing the number of tactors con-currently active. If this were the only cue available,then probably only three widely spaced intensityvalues are usable in a display (Geldard, 1960).\nLocus of Vibrotactile Stimulation\nThe spatial coordinates of a stimulus applied to\nthe skin are accurately represented in the centralnervous system, and so it has been proposed thatspatial information about the external world maybe communicated via tactile stimulation of theskin (e.g., van Erp, 2001).

It appears to be very intuitive toperceive an external direction from a single pointof stimulation on the body (van Erp, 2001). In gen-eral, the ability to localize a point of vibrotactile\nstimulation on the body is best when it is present-ed near anatomical points of reference such as thewrist, elbow, spine, or navel (Cholewiak & Collins,2003; Cholewiak et al., 2004; van Erp, 2001).\nOne common method of referencing space\naround the torso uses the 12 hours of the clock asspatial landmarks. Using a cylindrical keyboard as a response device that represented the 3-D sur-face of the waist, Cholewiak et al. (2004) deter-\nmined the number of sites around the waist atwhich participants could accurately localize vi-brotactile stimulation. The tactile array compriseda belt with 12 (intertactor spacing of 72 mm), 8(spacing of 107 mm), or 6 (spacing of 140 mm)tactors equidistantly spaced. Localization accu-racy averaged 74% correct with 12 tactors, and itimproved to 92% with 8 tactors and to 97% when6 tactors were used. Cholewiak et al. (2004) alsoreported that performance was better (by 2%\u20135%)if anchor points such as the spine or navel wereused as stimulation sites.Consistent with these \ufb01ndings, van Erp (2005)\nfound that localization accuracy was highest forstimuli presented in the midsagittal plane of thebody and that errors were higher for stimuli pre-sented on the side of the torso. In his experiment,participants were required to position a remotelycontrolled cursor to indicate the external directionof a localized vibration applied around the torso,a task resembling the conditions associated withusing tactile spatial cues for navigation or vehiclecontrol.\nWhen two-dimensional tactile arrays are used\nto determine localization accuracy, performanceappears to be highly dependent on intertactor spac-ing. Lindeman and Yanagida (2003) placed a 3 \u00d73\narray on the back with a 60-mm intertactor spacingand found that participants were able to identifythe location of a single vibrotactile stimulus withan 84% correct identi\ufb01cation rate. However, whena 3 \u00d73 array with an intertactor spacing of 25 mm\nwas tested on the dorsal surface of the forearm,participants were able to identify the location ofthe vibrotactile stimulus on only 53% of the trials(Oakley, Kim, Lee, & Ryu, 2006). In the lattersituation, one of the constraints in using a tactiledisplay is the limited skin surface available, partic-ularly if the display dimensions are kept constantacross participants. These results clearly indicatethat intertactor spacing, array configuration, andthe specific location on which the display ismounted all in\ufb02uence localization accuracy and\nFigure 5.

In these applications, a series of tactors inthe tactile display are sequentially activated and thepattern of activation represents a specific com-mand: for example, \u201cmove to the left\u201d (Jones,Lockyer, & Piateski, 2006). The effective designof a tactile display requires that the spacing of thetactors on the body is greater than the two-pointthreshold for vibrotactile stimulation (i.e., the min-imal distance at which two points of stimulation\nare reported). On the back the two-point thresholdfor discriminating vibratory stimuli is approxi-mately 10 to 11 mm, and it is the same regardlessof whether the stimuli are delivered simultane-ously or successively (Eskildsen, Morris, Collins,& Bach-y-Rita, 1969). These thresholds are con-siderably smaller than static two-point thresholdson the back, which are around 20 to 40 mm (Wein-stein, 1968), and indicate that dynamic stimuli en-hance the spatial acuity of the torso.\nIt is possible to augment the information pre-\nsented at a number of sites on the skin by makinguse of various illusory phenomena. One tactileillusion that has been studied at several differentlocations on the body is sensory saltation (Geldard,1975), a tactile illusion of displacement. This il-lusion can be demonstrated by placing three stim-ulators at three equally spaced locations on the\nskin \u2013 for example, on the forearm or back (Chole-wiak & Collins, 2000; Tan, Gray, et al., 2003) \u2013 andthen delivering three brief pulses at the \ufb01rst stim-ulator, followed by three pulses at the middlestimulator, and \ufb01nally three pulses at the most dis-tant stimulator. Rather than feeling three succes-sive taps at three distinct locations, most peopleperceive that the mechanical pulses are essential-ly evenly distributed across the skin surface, as ifthe stimulus were hopping from one location to thenext (hence the term \u201ccutaneous rabbit\u201d).\nThe parameter that appears to determine the per-\nceived spatial layout in sensory saltation is the tem-poral separation between the bursts of vibration.\nWhen the interstimulus intervals are between 20 and300 ms (optimally near 50 ms), the stimuli\nare perceived as being spatially distributed acrossthe skin surface. On the back, the tactors need tobe placed at distances no greater than 100 mm, andthe optimal number of pulses delivered to each tac-\ntor is between three and six (Geldard, 1975; Gel-dard & Sherrick, 1972). This phenomenon meansthat it would be possible to simulate a higher spa-tial density of tactors than is actually present in adisplay by using appropriate tactor spacing andinterstimulus intervals. Cholewiak and Collins(2000) have indeed shown that when salutatorypresentations are compared directly with veridicalpresentations of vibrotactile stimuli on the back,the sensations produced by the salutatory mode areindistinguishable from those presented veridical-ly most of the time.\nSummary\nOf the encoding parameters available for a vi-\nbrotactile stimulus \u2013 namely frequency, intensity,locus, and duration \u2013 the latter two hold the mostpromise for encoding information in a tactile dis-play.

Electrotactile displays stimulate the skin bypassing a current through surface electrodes (e.g.,typically gold, platinum, silver, or stainless steel)that directly stimulate afferent nerve fibers, incontrast to the mechanoreceptors activated by vi-brotactile displays. The sensations evoked by elec-trotactile stimulation are described qualitatively asa tingle, itch, buzz, or sharp and burning pain, de-pending on the stimulating voltage, current andwaveform, and the electrode size, skin location,and degree of hydration of the skin (Kaczmarek,Webster, Bach-y-Rita, & Tompkins, 1991).\nIn addition to these two categories of tactile dis-\nplays are static displays, which either statically\nindent the skin or apply shear forces to the skinsurface. This technology is typically used in dis-plays fabricated for presenting tactile cues to the\ufb01ngers, such as in displays embedded in handhelddevices (e.g., Poupyrev, Maruyama, & Rekimoto,2002) and in virtual Braille displays (L\u00e9vesque,Pasquero, Hayward, & Legault, 2005).Anumber of different actuator technologies\nhave been used in vibrotactile displays, such aselectromagnetic motors (e .g., Tactaid: Audiological\nEngineering Corp., Somerville, MA, http://www.tactaid.com; C2 tactor: Engineering AcousticsInc., Casselberry, FL, http://www.eaiinfo.com) andarrays of pins (e.g., Optacon: Bliss, Katcher, Rog-ers, & Shepard, 1970; Braille Note BN32: KGSCorp., Saitama, Japan, http://kgs-jpn.co.jp) thatindent the skin when activated by piezoelectricbimorphs.\nThe Tactaid, developed to assist speech com-\nprehension in hearing-impaired individuals, has ausable frequency range from 100 to 800 Hz, witha nominal peak frequency of 250 Hz. The C2 tac-tor also has a nominal frequency of 250 Hz andcan be programmed to display a range of tactileinputs that vary in frequency. Both of these tactors(see Figure 6) have been used in tactile displaysdeveloped for navigation and orientation and assensory aids for the impaired.

The Virtual BrailleDisplay is composed of a 10 \u00d76 matrix of piezo-\nelectric bender motors that apply tangential forcesto the skin to simulate contact with Braille char-acters (L\u00e9vesque, Pasquero, & Hayward, 2007).\nOver the past decade, a variety of small DC\nmotors have been used in a number of contexts toprovide tactile stimulation to the torso (Jones et al.,2006; Lindeman, Yanagida, Noma, & Hosaka,2006; van Erp, van V een, Jansen, & Dobbins, 2005).These motors (see Figure 6) typically vibrate byusing an off-axis weight on their rotor. The fre-quency of vibration is directly proportional to themotor\u2019s speed, which is a function of the drivingvoltage. If the rotor and attached weight are ex-posed, the motor is encased so that movement ofthe rotating mass is not impeded (Piateski &Jones, 2005).\nThe advantages of these motors are that they\nare simple to control and can produce vibrationson the skin that are readily perceptible. They do,however, have limited power-to-mass ratios, andin general the frequency and amplitude of the vi-bration is dif\ufb01cult to control independently, unlikesome of the electromagnetic motors (e.g., C2 tac-tor) described previously. The small DC motors areactivated at a \ufb01xed frequency (typically between80 and 250 Hz) and amplitude, and the number andlocation of the motors simultaneously active areused to convey information. Some tactile displayshave been designed so that they can be controlled\nwirelessly using communication technologiessuch as IEEE 802.11b (Wall, Weinberg, Schmidt,& Krebs, 2001), Bluetooth (Jones et al., 2006; Lin-deman et al., 2006), and infrared wireless (Gem-perle, Ota, & Siewiorek, 2001).\nSeveral electrotactile displays have been devel-\noped for use as sensory aids for those with hear-\ning (Summers et al., 1994) and visual disabilities(Kaczmarek&Haase, 2003; Saunders,1973). These\nsystems typically comprise an array of electrodesthat is stimulated with brief (50\u2013100 \u00b5s), constant-\ncurrent pulses (0.1\u201310 mA). Variations in the in-tensive and temporal parameters of stimulationand in the spatial sequence of electrodes activatedcan be used to convey information. The intensityof electrotactile stimuli can be modulated by vary-ing either the pulse duration or current amplitude.However, both the absolute threshold and sub-jective magnitude of electrotactile stimulationincrease rapidly with changes in current ampli-\ntude (Rollman, 1973), and so stimulation currentmust be controlled carefully to avoid painful sen-sations.\nOne further disadvantage of constant-current\nstimulation is that if there is poor contact betweenthe skin and an electrode, the decrease in effectivearea results in a higher current density and a muchstronger sensation of a sudden, sharp pain (Kacz-marek et al., 1991). A limitation of electrotactiledisplays in general is the small dynamic rangeavailable to present cues. The range from thresh-old to a maximal level that is comfortable and notpainful depends on the individual, stimulation site,and type of electrodes and waveform used; whenexpressed as a ratio of the maximum to minimumit varies from 1.2 (1.6 dB) to 10 (20 dB; Kaczmareket al., 1991).

In general these systems\nuse a camera and computer to capture the visualinformation, which is then presented via a tactilearray to the skin as a pictorial representation.\nOne such system is the Optacon ( optical to\ntactile converter), which was first marketed in\n1970 as an electronic device that permitted blindpeople to read printed material (Bliss et al., 1970).It comprises a lens module that is moved by theuser across a line of print and a tactile array ontowhich the blind person places his or her index \ufb01n-ger. As the lens is moved across a line of print, animage roughly the size of one print letter is feltmoving across the tactile display under the user\u2019s\ufb01nger. The tactile display is composed of a 24 \u00d7\n6 array of pins actuated by piezoelectric bimorphsthat vibrate at 230 Hz and cause the pins to indentthe skin.\nThe reading rate achieved with this system after\ntraining ranges from 50 (typical) to 100 (maximal)words per minute (wpm), which is considerablyslower than the typical reading rates for Englishtext of 300 wpm (600 wpm maximal) and100 wpm(250 wpm maximal) for Braille (Reed & Durlach,1998). Despite these limitations, more than 15,000Optacon devices were sold by Telesensory SystemsInc. between 1970 and 1990, but by the mid-1990spage scanners with optical character recognitionbecame the tool of choice for people with visualimpairments, as the scanners were less expensiveand easier to learn to use.\nTABLE 1: Characteristics and Applications of Tactile Displays\nDisplay Display \nDevice Function Actuators Location DimensionsOptacon\naReading device for Piezoelectric Fingertip 24 \u00d76 pin array,\nthose with visual bimorphs vibrating at 230 Hz\nimpairments\nVideotactbMobility aid for  Titanium Torso 768- and 32-\nthose with visual electrodes electrode arraysimpairments\nTactaid 7\ncAssists speech Inertial Sternum, neck, 7 tactors, vibrating \ncomprehension in actuators abdomen, or over 100- to 800-Hz those with hearing forearm rangeimpairments\nBalance Provides feedback Tactaid tactors Torso 3 \u00d716 array of tactors\nprosthesis\ndof body tilt (inertial actuators) ar ound torso, vibrating\nat 250 Hz\nVibrating Balance control and Li near actuators Insoles of 3 tactors in each sole, \ninsolesepostural stability (C2, Engineering shoes vibrating at 250 Hz\nAcoustics Inc.)\nTSASfNavigation aid for Pneumatic and Torso (vest) 22 pneumatic tactors, \npilots electromechanical vibrating at 50 Hz; \n(rototactors) electromechanical \ntactors vibrating at 150 Hz\nPersonal tactile Navigation aid DC pager motors Waist belt 8 tactors vibrating at\nnavigator\ngin unfamiliar 160 Hzenvironments\nCyberTouch\nhInteraction with Electromechanical Hand 6 tactors, one on each\nvirtual environments actuators \ufb01nger, one on the\npalm, vibrating at 0 to\n125 Hz\naBliss et al., 1970. bForeThought Development, LLC. cAudiological Engineering Inc. dWall et al., 2001. ePriplata et al., 2003. fTSAS =\nTactile Situation Awareness System; Rupert, 2000. gVan Erp et al., 2005. hImmersion Corp.", "doc_id": "3001a8a0-f74c-4ea5-8cfb-f225452ed892", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "82d72842502429efa5c9b55a870a16325a22b076cecb9546f8f5abfd4a9b106c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Jones_JoHFaE_2008.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3182}, "relationships": {"1": "29b4c722-9178-4383-99f3-ee8760f12dcc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "09dc3d91-09a7-4b86-9e64-010f62d07c16": {"__data__": {"text": "TACTILE DISPLAYS 101\nThe torso has also been used as a site for tac-\ntile displays for people with visual impairments.In these systems a visual image is presented to theskin using an array of vibrotactile or electrotactilestimulators in which the intensity (pulse width oramplitude) of the stimulus delivered by each stim-ulator is controlled by the light intensity at a sin-gle camera pixel. Early studies with these tactilevisual substitution systems (TVSSs) demonstrat-ed that participants could identify the orientationof lines presented tactually on the back using anarray of 400 vibrators and that experienced userscould identify tactile images of common objects(Bach-y-Rita, Collins, Saunders, White, & Scad-den, 1969).\nMore recently, an array of 768 titanium elec-\ntrodes called the Videotact has been fabricated andmarketed as a tactile visual substitution device(ForeThought Development LLC, Madison, WI;http://www.4thtdev.com). This display is worn onthe abdomen and shows promise as an aid for nav-igation in simple, high-contrast visual environ-ments. In more cluttered visual environments TVSS\nsystems are ineffective, as complex patterns needto be scanned sequentially, which signi\ufb01cantlyslows object recognition (Kaczmarek & Bach-y-Rita, 1995). However, a 96-element version (ETV\n4) of the Videotact has been used successfully byoperators to control a robot as it navigated througha 3-D maze (Segond, Weiss, & Sampaio, 2005).\nAnumber of auditory prostheses have been\ndeveloped that use electrotactile or vibrotactileinputs to assist with speech perception and pro-duction in deaf individuals and others with severehearing impairments. Most of these systems arebased on a cochlea model of speech with posi-tional encoding of frequency information in thespeech signal. Saunders, Hill, and Franklin (1981)developed an electrotactile auditory prosthesisknown as the Teletactor, which transformed theacoustic spectrum of a speech sound into a tactilepattern that was presented using a belt of 32 elec-trodes worn around the abdomen. It was found toimprove the speech clarity of deaf children and as-sist in auditory discrimination and comprehensionin some older individuals (Szeto & Riso, 1990).\nAvibrotactile aid known as the Tactaid (Audio-\nlogical Engineering Corp.) has been commercial-lyavailable for over 15 years and is used by deaf\nindividuals and others with severe hearing impair-ments who are unable or do not want to use a\ncochlear implant. One version of this device usesseven tactors (Tactaid 7) that are in contact with\nthe skin (usually on the sternum, neck, abdomen,or forearm), and variations in the amplitude, loca-tion, duration, and frequency (100\u2013800 Hz) of thevibrotactile inputs are used to encode propertiesof the acoustic signal. The acoustic signal is ini-tially processed to derive an estimate of the spec-tral location and amplitude of the \ufb01rst two formantregions of speech,which are then presented through\nthe tactor array (Reed & Delhorne, 1995). Studieswith this device in individuals with hearing impair-ments indicate that the Tactaid does facilitate the\ncomprehension of some speech sounds (improve-ments in sentence comprehension average 25%)and the identification of environmental sounds(Galvin et al., 1999; Reed & Delhorne,1995, 2003).\nTactile signals have also been shown to be of use\nin sound localization. In an early study, B\u00e9k\u00e9sy(1955) reported that with training, participantscould localize sound sources accurately when theonly cue regarding their origin was vibrotactilestimulation delivered to each forearm.

In one application, body tilt information ispresented via a tactile display to improve posturalstability, and hence prevent falls, in people withbalance impairments (Wall & Weinberg, 2003).The vibrotactile display is worn around the torsoand comprises a 3 \u00d716 array of tactors that vibrate\nat 250 Hz.

Preliminary testsshowed that use of the display signi\ufb01cantly reduced\nthe magnitude of body sway in participants withvestibular dysfunction (Wall & Weinberg, 2003).\nAsecond application involves using tactors\n(three per foot) that are embedded in gel insolesworn on the feet and present \u201ctactile noise\u201d to thesomatosensory system as a means of improvingpostural control.

In this application of tactile displays, vibro-tactile stimuli are used to present informationabout the intended direction of personal or vehiclemovement, the pitch and roll of an aircraft, and thelocation of way points in the environment.\nAtorso-based display known as the Tactile Situ-\nation Awareness System (TSAS) has been devel-oped as a navigation aid for navy pilots (Rupert,2000). Several prototypes of the TSAS have beendeveloped and tested, some with pneumaticallydriven tactors and others with electromechanicalstimulators. One prototype comprised 22 pneu-matic tactors that were mounted in a vest worn\nunder a \ufb02ight suit and activated using oscillatorycompressed air that forced the membrane on thetactor to vibrate at 50 Hz. The tactors were sequen-tiallyactivated to provide information about the\naircraft being controlled.\nIn one set of experiments the TSAS was used\nto provide pilots with information about helicoptervelocity direction (tactor location) and velocityvector magnitude (pulse pattern) so that they couldcontrol hovering (motionless \ufb02ight over a referencepoint) in the helicopter. A computer connected tothe altitude and velocity sensors on the helicoptertranslated its position and movement into tactilesignals. Test \ufb02ights involving 4 pilots \ufb02ying UH-60 helicopters were conducted and showed that theaircraft could be controlled using predominantlytactile cues (with visual cues significantly re-duced), that there was improved control of the air-craft during these complex \ufb02ight maneuvers, and\nthat the TSAS facilitated situational awareness andreduced workload (McGrath, Estrada, Braithwaite,Raj, & Rupert, 2004; Rupert, 2000).\nThe TSAS and other torso-based displays indi-cate that tactile signals presented to the torso can\nbe used to control a vehicle and maintain spatialorientation. These displays can also be used to alerta human operator and provide information aboutthe location of key features in an unknown envi-ronment.\nAnumber of studies have demonstrated that\ntactile displays can assist in navigation in unfa-miliar environments (Gilson et al., 2007; Jones etal., 2006; van Erp et al., 2005). In these contexts ithas been important to ascertain the optimal con-\ufb01guration of the tactors in the display (e.g., a belt,a dorsal and/or ventral vest, arm bands) and de-termine how direction and distance informationcan be conveyed effectively.\nVan Erp et al.

Consistent with Rupert\u2019s (2000)\ufb01ndings, van Erp et al. (2005) found that there didnot appear to be any dif\ufb01culty in interpreting vi-brotactile signals in a vibrating environment.\nUsing a different navigation task, in which the\ndirection of movement outdoors was signaled bya vibrotactile pattern delivered by a 4 \u00d74 tactor\narray mounted on the back, Jones et al. (2006) de-termined that participants had no dif\ufb01culty in inter-preting the vibration pattern to determine the path\nthat they should follow.

These devices vary from displays af\ufb01xedto chairs that stimulate the back (Lindeman &Yanagida, 2003) to gloves that track the move-\nments of the \ufb01ngers and represent these togetherwith contact in a virtual environment.\nThe CyberTouch glove developed by Immer-\nsion Corporation (San Jose, CA, http://www.immersion.com) for use in virtual environmentapplications has six individually programmablevibrotactile actuators, one mounted on the backof each \ufb01nger and one on the palm. The con\ufb01gu-ration of the hand is recorded from 22 sensors thatare located over the \ufb01nger joints and the wrist, andthe measurements from these sensors are used todrive the position and con\ufb01guration of a virtualhand presented to the user on a visual display. Thevibrotactile actuators attached to the glove are acti-vated whenever the virtual hand interacts with a\nvirtual object, which provides information aboutwhich \ufb01ngers are in contact with the object.\nAt present, these tactile displays deliver rather\nsimple vibrotactile inputs to the hand at single fre-quencies that are within the range of maximal sen-sitivities. The use of patterns of vibrotactile stimuli\nto convey information about objects or events ina real or simulated environment holds promiseand is starting to be implemented in new mobile\nphones (e.g., Immersion Corp. and Sanyo Seimi-tsu\u2019s VibeTonz).\nCommunication of Complex Concepts and\nMessages\nOne particular form of tactile signals, so-called\ntactons or tactile icons, represents structuredabstract messages that are designed to conveycomplex concepts and ideas (Brewster & Brown,2004; MacLean & Enriquez, 2003; Rinker, Craig,& Bernstein, 1998; Roberts & Franklin, 2005).They are the tactile equivalent of visual icons andauditory earcons, which have been de\ufb01ned as animage, picture, symbol, or sound representing aspeci\ufb01c event, object, or concept (Shneiderman,1998). Pasquero (2006) proposed that in order tobring added value to an interaction, tactile or hap-tic or icons must be (a) easy to learn and memo-\nrize, (b) carry meaning or emotional content, and(c) be universal and intuitive, and, at the sametime, support increasing levels of abstraction forexpert users. The challenge in creating tactons isin identifying which stimulus parameters mapmost effectively onto which concept.\nTactons encode information by simultaneously\nmanipulating several of the parameters of vibro-tactile stimuli described previously (see the Vi-brotactile Perception section) and illustrated inFigure 7. One critical but difficult aspect of de-signing tactons is in selecting those parameters anddetermining the range across which they can bevaried. Early efforts focused primarily on \ufb01rst or-der dimensions, such as stimulation frequency,amplitude, and duration. Limitations associatedwith using some of these parameters were firstnoted by Geldard (1957, 1960) in his efforts todevelop a tactile alphabetic code. Psychophysicalstudies of vibrotactile perception provide a frame-workfor determining which stimulus dimensions\nand what range of values are most likely to beperceived, and they indicate how some of thesedimensions, such as amplitude and frequency,interact.\nIt seems clear that stimuli that vary along a\nnumber of dimensions hold the most promise forthe development of tactons that convey abstractconcepts.

Compound tactons consist of a combina-tion of two or more simple tactons (such as a high-vs. a low-frequency pulse). Hierarchical tactonsrepresent nodes at various levels of a so-called tac-ton tree, in which tactons at lower levels inheritproperties from tactons at higher levels.

With this method, Enriquez,MacLean, and Chita (2006) created a set of ninehaptic icons that varied in terms of waveform andfrequency. They then trained participants to asso-ciate each haptic icon with an arbitrary concept,such as the name of a fruit. They found that par-ticipants learned these associations after about 25 min of training and achieved higher identi\ufb01ca-tionrates with stimuli that varied in frequency\n(81% correct), as compared with those that varied\nin waveform (73% correct).\nTactons have been developed as a means of\nsupporting attention and interruption managementin complex, event-driven domains. In this case,several properties of an interrupting task or eventare encoded in a vibrotactile signal to support peo-plein determining whether or not to reorient their\nattentional focus immediately or after some delay(Woods,1995). Tactons have been implemented asalerts on handheld devices such as pagers and mo-bile phones. Brown and Kaaresoja (2006) evalu-ated nine tactons that were used to communicatethe type of alert (voice call, text message, or mul-timedia message, represented by rhythm) and thepriority of the alert (low, medium, or high, repre-sented by roughness or intensity). Overall recog-nition rates of 72% were achieved, with rhythmand intensity being highly recognizable but\nroughness showing signi\ufb01cantly lower recogni-tion rates.\nTactons can also be employed in the context of\nlarge-scale supervisory control environments. Forexample, Hameed, Ferris, Jayaraman, and Sarter(2006) developed an interface to support watercontrol engineers in task scheduling and prioriti-zation. They encoded the nature, urgency, and dur-ationof a pending task by mapping this information\non the location, characteristic frequency, and dur-ation of the tactile signal, respectively (see Figure8). The information encoded in these signals wascorrectly interpreted in 94%, 90%, and 83% of allcases, respectively. Based on this partial informa-tion about a pending task, participants were able tomake more informed and appropriate decisionsabout attention switching than with traditionalrather uninformative interruption cues. They wereable to do so without incurring performance costson their main visual task.\nOther research has shown that complex tactile\nsignals are, in principle, feasible and useful but thattheir success is highly context dependent. Chan,MacLean, and McGrenere (2005) found that sev-en haptic icons could easily be learned in the ab-sence of workload and with minimal training. Theauthors also demonstrated that an increase in work-\nload resulted in detection times that were signif-icantly longer but still acceptable in most taskcontexts. The specific designs of the differenticons used in this research did, however, in\ufb02uencetheir susceptibility to workload effects.\nFigure 8.

Their use in virtual en-vironments has grown with the range of interfacesavailable to present tactile cues and clearly willexpand further as devices become lighter and lesscumbersome to use.\nThe optimal characteristics of a tactile display\nin terms of the minimum number of tactors re-quired to present information and their spacingand location across the skin surface clearly dependon the nature of the information being transmitted.Adisplay con\ufb01gured as a belt with eight tactors\ncan effectively provide directional cues that areaccurately perceived (van Erp et al., 2005), and theseven tactors worn by people with profound hear-ing impairments to assist in speech comprehensionand the identi\ufb01cation of environmental soundshave also been shown to be effective (Reed & Del-horne, 2003). Most of the systems developed andtested to date have stimulated the skin at a \ufb01xedfrequency and amplitude and have varied the loca-tion and number of tactors simultaneously active\nto convey information. Recent research on the de-velopment of tactons offers considerable promisein determining the properties of a tactile vocabu-lary that can be used to communicate both simpleand more abstract concepts.\nTHE ROLE OF TOUCH IN MULTIMODAL\nINTERFACES\nTactile displays are being developed both as\nstand-alone systems and as part of multimodal in-terfaces to complement other sensory channels andsupport a variety of functions. There is consider-able empirical evidence that they represent a valu-able addition to multimodal interfaces, providedtheir inclusion is based on need and appropriate-ness considerations, rather than the feasibility andavailability of tactile technologies.\nOne need that can be supported by adding tac-\ntile components to an interface is an increasedbandwidth of information transfer in complex, data-\nrich environments, such as process control and avi-ation, in which the visual and auditory channels\nhave traditionally been heavily relied upon (Hale& Stanney, 2004; Oviatt, 2003; Sarter, 2006; Sklar& Sarter, 1999). The sense of touch is being used\nto off-load these modalities and to present infor-mation that would otherwise be delayed or notavailable at all.\nTactile displays also support modality appro-\npriateness \u2013 that is, they increase the designer\u2019sability to choose among modalities and assignfunctions and types of information to the channelthat is best suited for their presentation. For ex-ample, spatial information maps well onto thehuman body, thus making the sense of touch thepreferred medium for information related to ori-entation and navigation. Tactile stimuli also repre-sent an effective means of attracting attention in asubtle yet reliable way (Ho, Reed, & Spence, 2006;Sarter, 2002, 2006). In some cases, they are there-fore preferred over auditory cues, which tend to behighly intrusive and most appropriate for criticalalarms that warrant interruption of any ongoingtasks and activities.\nOther reasons for including tactile cues in mul-\ntimodal interfaces are synergy (i.e., the mergingof information that is presented via several modal-ities and refers to various aspects of the same event\nor process), redundancy (i.e., the use of several mo-dalities for processing the exact same informationin an effort to improve detection rates and inter-pretation accuracy), and privacy. Privacy is impor-tant in public spaces, where a person may prefer toreceive tactile noti\ufb01cations from personal devicessuch as mobile phones.

People often manipu-late objects in the ir environment and, in fact, tend\nto feel that they need to handle and explore an ob-ject to have \u201cseen\u201d it. Tactile cues are thereforeadded to multimodal interfaces to support (a)grasping, manipulating, and identifying objects;(b) assessing texture, temperature, weight, andother attributes of objects; or (c) exploring spacesthat are not accessible to vision (Burdea & Coiffet,2003). Support for these functions is critical, forexample, in the context of multimodal interfaceswith virtual environments.\nThe inclusion of tactile signals in multimodal", "doc_id": "e6bbc0d0-04b0-4114-9f7a-adc0dcd3e2e4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8a594cfdaa1cbd6a346810b5609b61432d7b120411875ef48d4e8f14405684ed", "extra_info": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Jones_JoHFaE_2008.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3131, "end": 4716}, "relationships": {"1": "4da2324d-3773-4f94-823d-673456c3c85b", "2": "07cc550d-a046-4467-b3fd-d3d3df95e192"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "78634308-e4a8-4178-b509-f3a2d0c7273d": {"__data__": {"text": "TACTILE DISPLAYS 107\ninterfaces requires careful consideration of their\ncombination and synchronization with signalspresented in other modalities (Sarter, 2002, 2006).To date, little guidance has been available on how\nto approach this challenge. Some guidelines sug-gest that the combination of media should be min-imized as much as possible (ISO, 1998), whereas\nothers propose that modality combinations shouldbe based on factors such as user preference, needs,and abilities (e.g., European TelecommunicationsStandards Institute, 2002; ISO, 1998; Sutcliffe,2003).\nAccording to Reeves et al. (2004), modality in-\ntegration needs to be compatible not only with userpreference but also with context and system func-tionality (see also Sutcliffe, 2003). In current mul-timodal systems, an auditory alert is often followedby the visual presentation of related information,For example, route guidance systems in cars usean auditory signal to notify the driver of an upcom-ingturn, and a visual display then provides more\ndetailed information about the turn (Dingus &Hulse, 1993; Mollenhauer, Hulse, Dingus, Jahns,& Carney, 1997).\nArapidly growing body of work on cross-\nmodal links in attention (for overviews see Driver& Spence, 2004; Spence, Nicholls, Gillespie, &Driver, 1998) can inform the effective use of tac-tile cues in multimodal interfaces for the purposeof guiding attention in other modalities. Ho, Tan,and Spence (2005) studied the use of such vibro-tactile warning signals in the context of providingspatial information to car drivers. They presenteddrivers with a tactile stimulus on either their ab-domen or back and asked them to respond bychecking the front or the rearview mirror, respec-tively, for a rapidly approaching car and to brakeor accelerate accordingly. They found that partic-ipants responded significantly faster followingspatially predictive and nonpredictive vibrotactilecues that appeared on the same side as the criticaldriving events, thus showing that vibrotactile warn-ing signals can be highly effective in directing a\ndriver\u2019s visual attention.\nTactile cues have also been shown to be effec-\ntive in guiding visual attention to the location ofa critical event in the context of an air traf\ufb01c con-trol simulation (Hameed, Jayaraman, Ballard, &Sarter, 2007). In this study, participants monitoreda display depicting the \ufb02ight paths of 40 aircraftand were presented with tactile cues indicatingeither the occurrence only or both the occurrenceand display location of an event requiring a re-\nsponse. Tactile cuing, especially when combinedwith location information, resulted in signi\ufb01cant-ly higher detection rates and faster response timesto these events.\nRESEARCH NEEDS IN TACTILE \nDISPLAY DESIGN\nThe design of tactile interfaces is still at a rather\nearly stage, and a number of important researchquestions remain to be addressed with respect tothe design and effectiveness of tactile feedback byitself as well as to its integration with informationpresented in other modalities.\nFirst, with respect to the design and implemen-\ntation of tactile technologies, one important issueconcerns the dimensions and con\ufb01guration of tac-tile arrays in general and how they should changefor speci\ufb01c locations on the body and as a functionof the display\u2019s purpose.

Given the range of body siz-es that these displays will be mounted on, it will beimportant to determine whether it is better to usethe available sensory area by adjusting intertactordistances to cover the skin surface or to maintainthe same dimensions of the display for all users ina speci\ufb01c application.\nOther challenges in tactile display design in-\nclude the need for tactors that have a wide dynam-ic range, are power ef\ufb01cient, and are physicallyrobust.

Displays will need to be designed that can\nmaintain continuous contact with the skin underthese conditions and can present tactile signals ofsuf\ufb01cient magnitude that they are readily attendedto but not aversive.\nAsecond challenge for tactile display design re-\nlates to real-world domains and the selection of ap-propriate sites for presenting tactile signals. The\nmost sensitive body regions for tactile perception \u2013the tongue, lips, and \ufb01ngers \u2013 are off limits in mostof these environments because of intrusivenessand interference with user tasks. Thus, each newtactile display design requires a trade-off decisionbetween cutaneous sensitivity and feasibility/acceptance. Tactile patterns that are presentedacross a large sensory surface, such as the back, areeasier to recognize than similar patterns presentedon a smaller surface, such as on the forearm (Joneset al., 2006), but for both body sites high recogni-tion accuracy is obtained with the judicious selec-tion of tactile patterns (Jones, Kunkel, & Piateski,2007).\nOne promising approach for creating wearable\ndisplays is to integrate tactile technologies withdevices that users are wearing on a regular basis,such as headsets or seatbelts. It is also becomingincreasingly feasible to integrate sensor and actu-ator technology into garments made with wovenconductive fabrics that can be used for power anddata transmission (Wade & Asada, 2006). \nResearch on tactile patterns and tactons has\nfocused on their use in human-computer interac-tions and, in particular, on facilitating interactionswith graphical interfaces (Brewster & Brown,2004). A third research need is the developmentof tactons for navigation and communication inhazardous environments (Jones, Kunkel, & Torres,2007). The number of tactons that are potentiallyavailable for communication in these contexts willneed to be determined from analyses of how thebasic parameters of vibrotactile signals can becombined to create unique icons. Stimulus para-meters, such as stimulus waveform, that may beuseful for tactons displayed in handheld devices(Brown et al., 2005) may be ineffective in displaysmounted on other sites on the body. It seems clearthat the number of tactons that can be accuratelyidenti\ufb01ed at any location depends on the degreeof similarity among the various tactons presented(Enriquez et al., 2006; Jones, Kunkel, & Piateski,2007).Afourth issue that will need to be addressed is\nthe effect of aging on tactile perception and howit impacts the design of tactile displays that are in-tended for a wide range of users. Overall, a reducedspatial acuity for most body locations has beenreported for older people (J. C. Stevens & Choo,1996). In addition, a recent study on cross-modal\nattentional narrowing by Hess and Sarter (2007)found that under conditions of high visual load,older drivers were signi\ufb01cantly more likely to misstactile cues than were their younger counterparts \u2013a \ufb01nding with important implications for the de-sign of in-vehicle interfaces.\nIt appears that tactile cues are less affected by\ncross-modal spatial links and thus can be decou-pled from other attentional processes easily andeffectively (Eimer, 1999). Gray, Tan, and Young(2002) have shown that whereas visual and audi-tory stimuli have to be presented in close spatialproximity to produce performance bene\ufb01ts, prox-imal haptic cues can be used to reorient visualattention to areas in distal space.\nAlso, Ferris and Sarter (2008; this issue) found\nthat ipsilateral cuing resulted in slower responsetimes for visually cued tactile targets (comparedwith uncued tactile targets) but faster responsetimes for auditorily cued visual targets (as", "doc_id": "9457d915-12cb-42f9-8fb9-a91fdc772d0f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ab5c6789bc1a0e3dd3bfcad499fb6dd3232bf7063b0868282d490d65e805e173", "extra_info": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Jones_JoHFaE_2008.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3753}, "relationships": {"1": "abf8234a-3685-4631-a0fb-87e9ff370500", "3": "b15b9aa0-58ee-447b-8bb8-d56f6b731df7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b15b9aa0-58ee-447b-8bb8-d56f6b731df7": {"__data__": {"text": "for the de-sign of in-vehicle interfaces.\nIt appears that tactile cues are less affected by\ncross-modal spatial links and thus can be decou-pled from other attentional processes easily andeffectively (Eimer, 1999).

Asymmetries in interactions and theeffects of different modality pairings will need tobe elucidated.

Teaching history using a Virtual Reality Modelling Language model of Erechtheum  Demetra Eggarxou Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, Greece  Sarantos Psycharis University of the Aegean, Greece   ABSTRACT  The aim of this paper is to present a Virtual Reality Modelling Language VRML exploration of the Erechtheum in Athens.  It addresses the 4th grade students and it constitutes a teaching approach trough the use of various representations created with VRML language. The design principles of the applications are described in detail as well as the technical characteristics of the application. A pilot evaluation of the teaching approach is also presented and the results indicate a strong positive impact on students\u2019 performance. The application also aims to emphasize the significant advantages of VRML as an efficient way of offering ICT course materials to students.

The arguments for and against ICT are powerful and have triggered off a great interest in the issue of ICT induction in education. As a result a huge number of articles has been published which study this issue through a number of perspectives and provide the ground for further research. Some applications of ICT in education are the induction of movement techniques, movements with graphics, and simulations, the development of visual experiments, speedy exploration of data and observations storing, the development of multiple reconstructions etc. The greatest contribution however, of ICT in the educational process is the potential of modelling and simulating phenomena and procedures that facilitate scientific research and the exploration of the real world (Borkowski, 2002), in contrast to the procedure of simply acquiring knowledge out of a book manual.  According to Brant et.al, (1991) modelling is a computing process which includes a manageable and interactive environment and it corresponds to a real phenomenon or a theoretical system (Akpan, 2001). ICT provide also the tools that help students decide easily about the results of natural processes, interact with the software applications, carry out their own explorations on an individual or collective level etc.   ICT introduction in education establishes a dual relationship between the ICT and the learning theories and the teaching practice, since it reframes the teaching methodology of sciences through the use of ICT while it also brings up the crucial issue of teaching thinking skills through the use of ICT in the framework of a constructive learning environment. ICT contribute to the student\u2019s participation into the learning process and the invention of ways, which facilitate the active construction of his knowledge structure, as well as the understanding of this process. The fundamental principle of constructivism (e.g (Reiser 2001, Strijbos et.al 2004) is the active initiative and the control of learning by the learner, the personal construction of knowledge, that is ", "doc_id": "d33bb751-7cf2-40c4-a3ef-5a3186a6542f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "118115b8e56c0cdd3b5dbea5655e39930b554ba0441b7087dbdc2496802f0224", "extra_info": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "article_188028.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3284}, "relationships": {"1": "537b2b88-7e81-4226-a343-5225e83f01b3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "60ba6fde-0368-4a6b-8b5d-7c52490428e8": {"__data__": {"text": "116  IJEDICT  the self-control of learning (de Charms, 1983; Deci & Ryan, 1985) and ICT can give a shift towards that direction. The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can offer to both students and educators alike, quick access to historical sources, libraries and museums. Through the so-called \u201cdiscovery learning\u201d, they may also participate in research or problem-solving activities which help acquire a wider and broader perspective of History. One of the ways of utilising ICT is through VRML.  Recently, an increasing number of educators have access to virtual reality. Through the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), teachers and students can have a direct access to 3D learning environments on the Internet. VRML gives teachers the opportunity to enhance their students\u2019 knowledge, while simulated spaces can help students visualise information in new and realistic ways, give abstract concepts a realistic flavour and encourage cross-cultural, global communities.   Corporate VRML today tends to be focused primarily on enterprise and entertainment which do not usually contribute towards educational goals. As a response to this issue, an educational world for the Erechtheum has been developed, in an attempt to encourage a wide use of these simulations in traditional subject areas.

THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF THE APPLICATION  The organization and layout of the various structural components in space were based on the following design principles: \u2022 In order to simplify the location of the position of objects, the origin (0,0,0) of the root coordinate system is placed at the centre of the main temple and at an elevation which corresponds to the lowest level of the ground.

The application of textures is achieved through the use of a suitable scale so that a seemingly real picture is created, based on the object and its position in space.(see Appendix B) \u2022 During the design of the environment (description in VRML), some simplifications and assumptions were made. These include: the pediments and metopes have adopted elements present on the Parthenon (as the equivalent information for the Erechtheum is unknown), the real dimensions have not been adhered to exactly etc.   THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT  We created source code in VRML using the editor VrmlPad, the Cosmo Player Plug in and Photoshop for the creation of textures (Figure3) .  The environment as a whole is made up from the following structural components:  \u2022 Ground: Shows significant irregularities. It is made up of 6 boxes of varying sizes (4 coloured boxes for the creation of the ground irregularities and 2 boxes with a \u201cwall\u201d texture for the creation of two retaining walls for ground support). \u2022 Floors: Made up of thin boxes (0.30m) with a floor texture, variable scaling (depending on the size) for improved output. In particular, two shapes IndexedFaceSet were implemented for the ramp on the exterior of the structure, namely a vertical triangle and a parallelogram for the inclined surface. \u2022 Walls: These are made up of boxes of thickness 0.60m with a \u201cWall\u201d texture, each of which contains on its upper surface one narrow box of thickness 10cm and marble texture. The textures can be adjusted by different scaling such that uniformity is achieved. The interior divider is essentially a box with a colour texture. \u2022 Columns: These are of two types which differ in height. The first type is used on the front and rear of the temple and the second is used on the side (north). The columns form a group of objects (cylinders and one box) which can perform relative translational and rotational motions so that they can accurately be placed in position. Having formed the group as a whole, it is then moved to the root coordinate system so that it can be placed in the building.  Roof: The following components are analysed:  \u2022 Metopes: These are boxes forming horizontal plates. The middle one is larger in height and portrays the metopes (metopes1, metopes2), while the rest-using marble texture-are slender and protrude slightly along the perimeter. \u2022 Tiles: These are made up of very thin boxes which can be translated and rotated to the desired angle so that they are in accordance with the pediments. Their texture is marble tiles (Keram2). \u2022 Pediments: These are essentially triangles constructed using IndexedFaceSet, and the texture (aetoma) is achieved through the Texture Coordinates. \u2022 Statues: For the creation of the Caryatid, the 3D STRATA Studio programme was implemented, which created the body of the statue in IndexFaceSet version. Following this, the two bases (upper and lower) were added and the image of the statue as texture. This object was used 6 times in total, each time in the appropriate position, as an external object (inline).

Both classes consisted of 25 students with approximately equal distribution of boys and girls.  The process  One of the classes \u2013 which was characterized as the control group - was taught the concepts of Erechtheum, applying the constructivist approach through the use of the relevant school textbook. Students were motivated by the teacher to think about Erechtheum and they were involved in the different phases of constructivist approach to learning and teaching (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate) (Bybee, 1997). The main differences of the teaching process for the two groups concerned the way of the implementation of the above mentioned phases.  Students of the control group were exposed to pictures of the Erechtheum, they were asked to describe in brief what is, who was the creator, what is the main issue they think makes that to be famous e.t.c.. Next, students were taught the different parts of the Erechtheum using the text book, they explore the parts of it using the pictures provided by the book and they discussed with the teacher the architecture of the Erechtheum as well as aspects like the materials used to construct that, the colors used etc. The experimental class was taught concepts through the use of the school textbook but teachers also demonstrated the software and students exploited the Erechtheum with the aid of the teacher.   Students were motivated to go through the Erechtheum using the buttons provided by the software and during that exploration we noticed that a type of dialogue was developed concerning the status, the dresses at that time, the geometry of the space and the techniques of the sculpture. For the experimental and the control classes the teaching units were equivalent but the experimental unit devoted two more teaching hours for the demonstration of the VRML application. Before starting teaching a common pre-checking test was given to all of the students in both classes in order to estimate the students\u2019 cognitive level about issues relative to Erechtheum. After the end of the teaching process a common post test was given to all of the students.  Finally, teachers were encouraged to discuss about the experiences they had in their teaching and to identify effective teaching and learning which had occurred, as well as problems which had noticed.   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS  The students\u2019 cognitive achievement (at the initial test) average in the two classes was \u039c=1,7  SD=0,3 for the control class and \u039c=1,8, SD=0,5 for the experimental class(maximum grade is 6). Analysis of co-variation ANCOVA for the two groups and the pre- and the post-test yielded the following results: The F ratio that refers to the relations between groups of the research design (two groups and two tests) is 10,542 with p significance less than the 0,001 level. Thus, we accept that the interaction is highly significant. After the teaching process,the cognitive achievement average for the control group increases from \u039c=1,7 to \u039c=3,8 whereas as the experimental group is concerned, it increases from \u039c=1,8 to \u039c=4,9.The difference between the averages for each class is statistically significant. For the control group t=-5,446 with significance level p<0.001 and for the experimental group t=-8,489 with p<0.001. From the results, there is strong evidence that simulated spaces help students visualize information in new ways and give abstract concepts concrete form.

This project may be developed further using collaborative learning tools (such as CMAP) so that students are able to cooperate and explore relevant architectural issues, historical sources etc.(work in progress). Further research (in process) will be focused on using this application to investigate issues like : \u201cHow do students perceive the learning course in relation to the use of VRML environments?\u201d, \u201cDoes approach to learning change over the duration of the course due to the use of VRML?\u201d and \u201cWhat metacognitive development takes place in the course due to VRML?\u201d.
