how vibrotactile perception stimulate skin,"Based on the additional context provided, it seems that the original answer adequately addresses the question about how vibrotactile perception stimulates the skin. Therefore, no further refinement is needed.",,,2023-06-30 15:18:43.310317
what are future research directions of haptic,"Based on the new context provided, the original answer remains relevant and applicable. The future research directions of haptic technology, as mentioned earlier, still hold true. These include understanding tactile perception, exploring cognitive processes, integrating multiple sensory inputs, and analyzing complex manual skills. The context of movements made under visual guidance using an operating microscope further emphasizes the importance of studying highly skilled activities, such as microsurgery, and investigating the role of vision in haptic perception. Additionally, research can focus on understanding the specific factors that enable the motor system to function effectively beyond the limits imposed by normal vision in these situations.",,,2023-06-30 15:39:31.655664
